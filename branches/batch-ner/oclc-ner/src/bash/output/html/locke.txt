His ideas had enormous influence on the development of epistemology and political philosophy , and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers , classical republicans , and contributors to liberal theory . His writings influenced <span class="per">Voltaire</span> and <span class="per">Rousseau</span> , many <span class="misc">Scottish</span> Enlightenment thinkers , as well as the <span class="misc">American</span> revolutionaries . This influence is reflected in the <span class="misc">American</span> Declaration of <span class="loc">Independence</span> . [ 1 ] <span class="per">Locke</span> 's theory of mind is often cited as the origin for modern conceptions of identity and " the self " , figuring prominently in the later works of philosophers such as <span class="per">David Hume</span> , <span class="per">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</span> and <span class="per">Immanuel Kant</span> . <span class="per">Locke</span> was the first philosopher to define the self through a continuity of " consciousness " . He also postulated that the mind was a " blank slate " or " tabula rasa " ; that is , contrary to <span class="misc">Cartesian</span> or <span class="misc">Christian</span> philosophy , <span class="per">Locke</span> maintained that people are born without innate ideas .
