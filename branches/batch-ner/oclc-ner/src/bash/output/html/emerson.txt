His teachings directly influenced the growing <span class="org">New Thought</span> movement of the mid 1800s . <span class="per">Emerson</span> gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries , formulating and expressing the philosophy of <span class="loc">Transcendentalism</span> in his 1836 essay , <span class="org">Nature</span> . As a result of this ground breaking work he gave a speech entitled The <span class="misc">American</span> Scholar in 1837 , which <span class="per">Oliver Wendell Holmes</span> , Sr. considered to be <span class="loc">America</span> 's " <span class="org">Intellectual Declaration of Independence</span> " . [ 1 ] Considered one of the great orators of the time , <span class="per">Emerson</span> 's enthusiasm and respect for his audience enraptured crowds . His support for abolitionism late in life created controversy , and at times he was subject to abuse from crowds while speaking on the topic , however this was not always the case . When asked to sum up his work , he said his central doctrine was " the infinitude of the private man . " [ 2 ] </div><hr/></body></html>
