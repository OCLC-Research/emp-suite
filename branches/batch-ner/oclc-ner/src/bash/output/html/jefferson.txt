Kennedy</span> welcomed forty-nine <span class="org">Nobel Prize</span> winners to the <span class="loc">White House</span> in 1962 he said , " I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent and of human knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the <span class="loc">White House</span> – with the possible exception of when <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span> dined alone . " [ 3 ] To date , <span class="per">Jefferson</span> is the only president to serve two full terms in office to veto no bill of <span class="org">Congress</span> . <span class="per">Jefferson</span> has been consistently ranked by scholars as one of the greatest <span class="loc">U.S.</span> presidents . </div><hr/></body></html>
