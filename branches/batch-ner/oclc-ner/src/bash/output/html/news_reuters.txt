Bush</span> heads to storm-battered <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> on Wednesday to survey damage from Hurricane <span class="per">Gustav</span> as tens of thousands who fled <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> prepare to return to a " dark and hot " city struggling to restore power and maintain basic services . The visit by <span class="per">Bush</span> , who was widely criticized for a slow response to Hurricane <span class="per">Katrina</span> , is part of an effort by officials to show that they learned the lessons from the 2005 storm that killed 1,500 people and caused $80 billion in damage . <span class="per">Bush</span> , who skipped the <span class="org">Republican National Convention</span> to oversee the response to <span class="per">Gustav</span> , was expected to arrive in <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span> on Wednesday morning just as residents begin to pour back into the area around <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> . Cars and pickup trucks packed with families , bedding , cats and dogs streamed into <span class="org">Jefferson Parish</span> before dawn , the first evacuees of greater <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> to come home after <span class="per">Gustav</span> . Nearly 2 million fled the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> coast , including some 95 percent of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> 's residents - an unprecedented exodus credited with saving lives . <span class="per">Homemaker Christy Murray</span> spent a month evacuated after <span class="per">Katrina</span> and said authorities handled <span class="per">Gustav</span> much better . " It was 100 percent better than <span class="per">Katrina</span> , " she said . " There was no chaos this time . We were surprised . We came right in from <span class="loc">Alabama</span> , straight in this time . It was wonderful . " On Tuesday , <span class="per">Bush</span> declared a major disaster across much of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> , where most homes and businesses remain without electricity and hospitals running on backup-power are wary of being overrun by returnees . <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> Mayor <span class="per">Ray Nagin</span> said residents could return on Thursday , lifting a mandatory evacuation order , while <span class="org">City Council</span> President <span class="per">Jackie Clarkson</span> warned they would find a city that is " dark and hot . " " We want you to come into the city , check on your property , make sure that you are comfortable and make an intelligent decision on whether you want to stay in this environment or not , " <span class="per">Nagin</span> told reporters . Hurricane <span class="per">Gustav</span> delivered only a glancing blow to <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and the region 's crucial oil and gas infrastructure when it barreled ashore in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> on Monday . Almost all <span class="loc">U.S.</span> energy production in the <span class="loc">Gulf</span> of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> remained shut but producers said they found little damage to refineries and offshore platforms . Crude oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday as supply fears eased , trading near five-month lows . <span class="per">Gustav</span> also tested a levee system being rebuilt to protect <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> from the kind of deluge that followed <span class="per">Katrina</span> , when protections for the city built below sea level collapsed . Although reinforced <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> flood protections will not be finished until 2011 , the levees held up under the pounding from <span class="per">Gustav</span> . Water surged over floodwalls and squirted through cracks but the city stayed mainly dry . LOW DEATH TOLL <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> reported just six deaths in the immediate wake of the storm . <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> police also said they had arrested only two people for looting during the storm . That was stark contrast to <span class="per">Katrina</span> 's aftermath , when looters roamed the streets and rescue helicopters plucked thousands of people from rooftops and bridges . The <span class="org">Times Picayune</span> , the city 's daily newspaper , said in an editorial on Wednesday that residents were wrong to begin " second-guessing " the urgent call by officials for the large evacuation that peaked during the weekend . " The low number of fatalities spoke volumes about the effectiveness of one of the nation 's largest and most efficient evacuations , " the newspaper said in an editorial . Meanwhile , <span class="loc">U.S.</span> disaster officials turned their eye to new , dangerous storms churning in the <span class="loc">Atlantic</span> . Tropical Storm <span class="per">Hanna</span> was moving through the <span class="loc">Bahamas</span> and threatened the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> <span class="misc">East Coast</span> from <span class="loc">Florida</span> to the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span> , and tropical storms <span class="per">Ike</span> and <span class="per">Josephine</span> trekked westward toward the <span class="loc">Caribbean</span> . The <span class="org">Miami-based National Hurricane Center</span> said <span class="per">Hanna</span> was expected to move near the central <span class="loc">Bahamas</span> as it begins to strengthen again toward hurricane force .
