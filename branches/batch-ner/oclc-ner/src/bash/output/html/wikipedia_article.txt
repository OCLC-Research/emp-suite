The war involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel , making it the most widespread war in history . In a state of " total war " , the major participants placed their complete economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . Over 70 million people , the majority of them civilians , were killed , making it the deadliest conflict in human history . The starting date of the war is generally held to be September 1939 with the <span class="misc">German</span> invasion of <span class="loc">Poland</span> and subsequent declarations of war on <span class="loc">Germany</span> by the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> , <span class="loc">France</span> and the <span class="misc">British</span> Dominions . However , as a result of other events , many belligerents entered the war before or after this date , during a period which spanned from 1937 to 1941 . Amongst these main events are the <span class="per">Marco Polo Bridge Incident</span> , the start of <span class="misc">Operation Barbarossa</span> and the attack on <span class="loc">Pearl Harbour</span> and <span class="misc">British</span> and <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> colonies in <span class="loc">South East Asia</span> . The <span class="loc">Soviet Union</span> and the <span class="loc">United States</span> emerged as the world 's leading superpowers . This set the stage for the <span class="misc">Cold War</span> , which lasted for the next 45 years . The <span class="org">United Nations</span> was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict . The self determination spawned by the war accelerated decolonization movements in <span class="loc">Asia</span> and <span class="loc">Africa</span> , while <span class="loc">Western Europe</span> itself began moving toward integration . In the aftermath of <span class="misc">World War I</span> , a defeated <span class="loc">Germany</span> signed the <span class="org">Treaty</span> of <span class="org">Versailles</span> . This caused <span class="loc">Germany</span> to lose a significant portion of its territory , prohibited the annexation of other states , limited the size of <span class="misc">German</span> armed forces and imposed massive reparations . <span class="loc">Russia</span> 's civil war led to the creation of the <span class="loc">Soviet Union</span> which soon was under the control of <span class="per">Joseph Stalin</span> . In <span class="loc">Italy</span> , <span class="per">Benito Mussolini</span> seized power as a fascist dictator promising to create a " New <span class="loc">Roman Empire</span> . " The ruling <span class="org">Kuomintang</span> ( <span class="org">KMT</span> ) party in <span class="loc">China</span> launched a unification campaign against rebelling warlords in the mid-1920s , but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former <span class="misc">Chinese</span> communist allies . In 1931 , an increasingly militaristic <span class="misc">Japanese Empire</span> , which had long sought influence in <span class="loc">China</span> as the first step of its right to rule <span class="loc">Asia</span> , used the <span class="misc">Mukden Incident</span> as justification to invade <span class="loc">Manchuria</span> ; the two nations then fought several small conflicts until the <span class="per">Tanggu Truce</span> in 1933 . <span class="misc">German</span> troops at the 1935 <span class="misc">Nuremberg Rally</span> . <span class="misc">German</span> troops at the 1935 <span class="misc">Nuremberg Rally</span> . National Socialist <span class="per">Adolf Hitler</span> became the leader of <span class="loc">Germany</span> in 1933 and soon began a massive rearming campaign . This worried <span class="loc">France</span> and the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> , who had lost much in the previous war , as well as <span class="loc">Italy</span> , which saw its territorial ambitions threatened by those of <span class="loc">Germany</span> . To secure its alliance , the <span class="misc">French</span> allowed <span class="loc">Italy</span> a free hand in <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> , which <span class="loc">Italy</span> desired to conquer . The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the <span class="loc">Saarland</span> was legally reunited with <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="per">Hitler</span> repudiated the <span class="org">Treaty</span> of <span class="org">Versailles</span> , speeding up remilitarization and introducing conscription . Hoping to contain <span class="loc">Germany</span> , the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> , <span class="loc">France</span> and <span class="loc">Italy</span> formed the <span class="org">Stresa Front</span> . The <span class="loc">Soviet Union</span> , concerned due to <span class="loc">Germany</span> 's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern <span class="loc">Europe</span> , concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with <span class="loc">France</span> . Before taking effect though , the <span class="misc">Franco-Soviet</span> pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the <span class="org">League of Nations</span> , rendering it essentially toothless and in June 1935 , the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> made an independent naval agreement with <span class="loc">Germany</span> easing prior restrictions . The <span class="loc">United States</span> , concerned with events in <span class="loc">Europe</span> and <span class="loc">Asia</span> , passed the <span class="org">Neutrality Act</span> in August . In October , <span class="loc">Italy</span> invaded <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> , with <span class="loc">Germany</span> the only major <span class="misc">European</span> nation supporting her invasion . <span class="loc">Italy</span> then revoked objections to <span class="loc">Germany</span> 's goal of making <span class="loc">Austria</span> a satellite state . In direct violation of the <span class="org">Versailles</span> and <span class="loc">Locarno</span> treaties , <span class="per">Hitler</span> remilitarized the <span class="loc">Rhineland</span> in March 1936 . He received little response from other <span class="misc">European</span> powers . When the <span class="misc">Spanish Civil War</span> broke out in July , <span class="per">Hitler</span> and <span class="per">Mussolini</span> supported fascist General√≠simo <span class="per">Francisco Franco</span> 's nationalist forces in his civil war against the <span class="misc">Soviet-supported Spanish Republic</span> . Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare and the nationalists would prove victorious in early 1939 . With tensions mounting , efforts to strengthen or consolidate power were made . In October , <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="loc">Italy</span> formed the <span class="misc">Rome-Berlin</span> Axis and a month later <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="loc">Japan</span> , each believing communism and the <span class="loc">Soviet Union</span> in particular to be a threat , signed the <span class="misc">Anti-Comintern</span> Pact , which <span class="loc">Italy</span> would join in the following year . In <span class="loc">China</span> , the <span class="org">Kuomintang</span> and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose <span class="loc">Japan</span> . Chronology Other dates for the beginning of war include the <span class="misc">Japanese</span> invasion of <span class="loc">Manchuria</span> in 1931 , the start of the Second <span class="misc">Sino-Japanese War</span> in 1937 , or one of several other events . Other sources follow <span class="per">A. J. P. Taylor</span> , who holds that there was a simultaneous <span class="misc">Sino-Japanese War</span> in <span class="loc">East Asia</span> , and a Second <span class="misc">European War</span> in <span class="loc">Europe</span> and her colonies , but they did not become a <span class="misc">World War</span> until they merged in 1941 ; at which point the war continued until 1945 . This article uses the conventional dating . The end of the War also has several dates . Some sources end it from the armistice of August 14 , 1945 , rather than the formal surrender ; in some <span class="misc">European</span> histories , it ended on <span class="misc">V-E Day</span> . The <span class="org">Treaty</span> of Peace with <span class="loc">Japan</span> was not signed until 1951 . In mid-1937 , following the <span class="misc">Marco Polo Bridge Incident</span> , <span class="loc">Japan</span> began a full invasion of <span class="loc">China</span> . The <span class="misc">Soviets</span> quickly lent support to <span class="loc">China</span> , effectively ending <span class="loc">China</span> 's prior cooperation with <span class="loc">Germany</span> . Starting at <span class="loc">Shanghai</span> , the <span class="misc">Japanese</span> pushed <span class="misc">Chinese</span> forces back , capturing the capital <span class="loc">Nanjing</span> in December . In June of 1938 <span class="misc">Chinese</span> forces stalled the <span class="misc">Japanese</span> advance by flooding the <span class="loc">Yellow River</span> ; though this bought time to prepare their defenses at <span class="loc">Wuhan</span> , the city was still taken by October . [ During this time , <span class="misc">Japanese</span> and <span class="misc">Soviet</span> forces engaged in a minor skirmish at <span class="loc">Lake Khasan</span> ; in May of 1939 , they became involved in a more serious border war that ended with signing a cease-fire agreement on September 15 and restoring the status quo ante bellum . </div><hr/></body></html>
