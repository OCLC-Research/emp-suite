This informal portrait is a conversation piece , a genre favored by <span class="per">Devis</span> . The figures , while full-length , are relatively small and are placed somewhat back in the landscape ; the background is larger and more detailed than in traditional portraiture and describes the subjects' personal and social context . <span class="per">Devis</span> devised a repertoire of postures and gestures that he used to express the social status of his sitter . <span class="per">Arthur Holdsworth</span> , governor of <span class="loc">Dartmouth Castle</span> , is shown seated , an alert , attentive expression on his face . The ship sailing into the mouth of the <span class="loc">River Dart</span> in the background may be a reference to the <span class="per">Holdsworth</span> family 's trading business . <span class="per">Holdsworth</span> 's brother-in-law , <span class="per">Thomas Taylor</span> , stands behind him in riding clothes . The third man is Captain Stancombe . From <span class="per">Gardner</span> ( 11th ed . ) <span class="org">Art History Survey Text</span> 1 . THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVERS When humans first gave up the dangerous and uncertain life of the hunter and gatherer for the more predictable and stable life of the farmer and herder , the change in human society was so astounding , so fundamental , that it justly has been called the <span class="loc">Neolithic Revolution</span> . This revolutionary change in the nature of daily life first occurred in <span class="loc">Mesopotamia</span> a <span class="misc">Greek</span> word that means " the land between the <span class="loc">Tigris</span> and <span class="loc">Euphrates</span> rivers . " <span class="loc">Mesopotamia</span> is at the core of the region often called the <span class="org">Fertile Crescent</span> , a land mass that forms a huge arc from the mountainous border between <span class="loc">Turkey</span> and <span class="loc">Syria</span> through <span class="loc">Iraq</span> to <span class="loc">Iran</span> 's <span class="loc">Zagros Mountain</span> range . There humankind first learned how to use the wheel and the plow , how to control floods and construct irrigation canals . The land became an oasis – and the presumed setting for the biblical <span class="loc">Garden</span> of <span class="loc">Eden</span> . As the region that gave birth to three of the world 's great modern faiths-- <span class="misc">Judaism</span> , Christianity , and <span class="misc">Islam</span> --the <span class="loc">Near East</span> long has been of interest to history and religion students . But not until the nineteenth century did systematic excavation open the world 's eyes to the extraordinary art and architecture of the ancient <span class="misc">Mesopotamians</span> . The great museums of <span class="loc">Europe</span> quickly began to fill their galleries with stone reliefs depicting warfare and hunting ( figs . 2-22 , 2-24 , and 2-25 ) and with colossal statues of monstrous human-headed bulls ( fig . 2-21 ) from the palaces of the <span class="misc">Assyrians</span> , rulers of a northern <span class="misc">Mesopotamian</span> empire during the ninth to the seventh centuries b.c . In the treasure-hunting spirit of the era , <span class="per">Austen Henry Layard</span> , one of the pioneers of <span class="misc">Near Eastern</span> archeology , had specific instructions from the <span class="org">British Museum</span> . He was to obtain as many well-preserved artworks as he could while spending the least possible amount of time and money doing so . Interest heightened with each new discovery , and <span class="misc">North American</span> museums also began to collect <span class="misc">Near Eastern</span> art . Nothing that emerged from the <span class="misc">Mesopotamian</span> soi l attracted as much attention as the treasures <span class="per">Leonard Woolley</span> discovered in the 1920s at the <span class="loc">Royal Cemetery</span> at <span class="loc">Ur</span> in southern <span class="loc">Mesopotamia</span> . The interest in the unearthing of lavish third-millennium b.c . Sumerian burials rivaled the public fascination with the 1922 discovery of the <span class="misc">Egyptian</span> boy-king <span class="misc">Tutankhamen</span> 's tomb ( see figs . 3-36 to 3-38 ) . The <span class="loc">Ur</span> cemetery was filled with gold objects , jewelry , artworks , and musical instruments ( figs . 2-8 to 2-11 ) . <span class="loc">Europe</span> 's royalty and elite frequently visited the site . One of the visitors was the mystery writer <span class="per">Agatha Christie</span> , who later married one of the <span class="misc">British</span> archeologists working at <span class="loc">Ur</span> . Her 1936 Murder in <span class="loc">Mesopotamia</span> centers on an excavation in <span class="loc">Iraq</span> . The discovery of the treasures of ancient <span class="loc">Ur</span> put the <span class="misc">Sumerians</span> once again in a prominent position on the world stage . They had been absent for four thousand years . </div><hr/></body></html>
