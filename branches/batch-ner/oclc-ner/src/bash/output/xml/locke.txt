<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner"><ner:per>John Locke</ner:per> ( pronounced /lɒk/ ; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704 ) was an <ner:misc>English</ner:misc> philosopher . <ner:per>Locke</ner:per> is considered the first of the <ner:misc>British</ner:misc> empiricists , but is equally important to social contract theory . His ideas had enormous influence on the development of epistemology and political philosophy , and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers , classical republicans , and contributors to liberal theory . His writings influenced <ner:per>Voltaire</ner:per> and <ner:per>Rousseau</ner:per> , many <ner:misc>Scottish</ner:misc> Enlightenment thinkers , as well as the <ner:misc>American</ner:misc> revolutionaries . This influence is reflected in the <ner:misc>American</ner:misc> Declaration of <ner:loc>Independence</ner:loc> . [ 1 ] <ner:per>Locke</ner:per> 's theory of mind is often cited as the origin for modern conceptions of identity and " the self " , figuring prominently in the later works of philosophers such as <ner:per>David Hume</ner:per> , <ner:per>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</ner:per> and <ner:per>Immanuel Kant</ner:per> . <ner:per>Locke</ner:per> was the first philosopher to define the self through a continuity of " consciousness " . He also postulated that the mind was a " blank slate " or " tabula rasa " ; that is , contrary to <ner:misc>Cartesian</ner:misc> or <ner:misc>Christian</ner:misc> philosophy , <ner:per>Locke</ner:per> maintained that people are born without innate ideas .
