<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner"><ner:per>Ralph Waldo Emerson</ner:per> ( May 25 , 1803 â€“ April 27 , 1882 ) was an <ner:misc>American</ner:misc> essayist , philosopher and poet , best remembered for leading the transcendentalist movement of the early 19th century . His teachings directly influenced the growing <ner:org>New Thought</ner:org> movement of the mid 1800s . <ner:per>Emerson</ner:per> gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries , formulating and expressing the philosophy of <ner:loc>Transcendentalism</ner:loc> in his 1836 essay , <ner:org>Nature</ner:org> . As a result of this ground breaking work he gave a speech entitled The <ner:misc>American</ner:misc> Scholar in 1837 , which <ner:per>Oliver Wendell Holmes</ner:per> , Sr. considered to be <ner:loc>America</ner:loc> 's " <ner:org>Intellectual Declaration of Independence</ner:org> " . [ 1 ] Considered one of the great orators of the time , <ner:per>Emerson</ner:per> 's enthusiasm and respect for his audience enraptured crowds . His support for abolitionism late in life created controversy , and at times he was subject to abuse from crowds while speaking on the topic , however this was not always the case . When asked to sum up his work , he said his central doctrine was " the infinitude of the private man . " [ 2 ] </ner:content>
