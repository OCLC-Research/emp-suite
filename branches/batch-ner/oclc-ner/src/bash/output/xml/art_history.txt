<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner">The <ner:misc>British</ner:misc> demand for portraiture increased rapidly in the eighteenth century as members of the wealthy middle class became art patrons in their own right . <ner:per>Arthur Devis</ner:per> was a provincial artist who came to live in <ner:loc>London</ner:loc> , where sophisticated portraitists of the upper class such as <ner:org>Reynolds</ner:org> and <ner:org>Gainsborough</ner:org> dominated the art world . <ner:per>Devis</ner:per> received commissions from the middle-class landowning families , merchants , and officials who lived in smaller cities outside <ner:loc>London</ner:loc> . This informal portrait is a conversation piece , a genre favored by <ner:per>Devis</ner:per> . The figures , while full-length , are relatively small and are placed somewhat back in the landscape ; the background is larger and more detailed than in traditional portraiture and describes the subjects' personal and social context . <ner:per>Devis</ner:per> devised a repertoire of postures and gestures that he used to express the social status of his sitter . <ner:per>Arthur Holdsworth</ner:per> , governor of <ner:loc>Dartmouth Castle</ner:loc> , is shown seated , an alert , attentive expression on his face . The ship sailing into the mouth of the <ner:loc>River Dart</ner:loc> in the background may be a reference to the <ner:per>Holdsworth</ner:per> family 's trading business . <ner:per>Holdsworth</ner:per> 's brother-in-law , <ner:per>Thomas Taylor</ner:per> , stands behind him in riding clothes . The third man is Captain Stancombe . From <ner:per>Gardner</ner:per> ( 11th ed . ) <ner:org>Art History Survey Text</ner:org> 1 . THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVERS When humans first gave up the dangerous and uncertain life of the hunter and gatherer for the more predictable and stable life of the farmer and herder , the change in human society was so astounding , so fundamental , that it justly has been called the <ner:loc>Neolithic Revolution</ner:loc> . This revolutionary change in the nature of daily life first occurred in <ner:loc>Mesopotamia</ner:loc> a <ner:misc>Greek</ner:misc> word that means " the land between the <ner:loc>Tigris</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Euphrates</ner:loc> rivers . " <ner:loc>Mesopotamia</ner:loc> is at the core of the region often called the <ner:org>Fertile Crescent</ner:org> , a land mass that forms a huge arc from the mountainous border between <ner:loc>Turkey</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Syria</ner:loc> through <ner:loc>Iraq</ner:loc> to <ner:loc>Iran</ner:loc> 's <ner:loc>Zagros Mountain</ner:loc> range . There humankind first learned how to use the wheel and the plow , how to control floods and construct irrigation canals . The land became an oasis – and the presumed setting for the biblical <ner:loc>Garden</ner:loc> of <ner:loc>Eden</ner:loc> . As the region that gave birth to three of the world 's great modern faiths-- <ner:misc>Judaism</ner:misc> , Christianity , and <ner:misc>Islam</ner:misc> --the <ner:loc>Near East</ner:loc> long has been of interest to history and religion students . But not until the nineteenth century did systematic excavation open the world 's eyes to the extraordinary art and architecture of the ancient <ner:misc>Mesopotamians</ner:misc> . The great museums of <ner:loc>Europe</ner:loc> quickly began to fill their galleries with stone reliefs depicting warfare and hunting ( figs . 2-22 , 2-24 , and 2-25 ) and with colossal statues of monstrous human-headed bulls ( fig . 2-21 ) from the palaces of the <ner:misc>Assyrians</ner:misc> , rulers of a northern <ner:misc>Mesopotamian</ner:misc> empire during the ninth to the seventh centuries b.c . In the treasure-hunting spirit of the era , <ner:per>Austen Henry Layard</ner:per> , one of the pioneers of <ner:misc>Near Eastern</ner:misc> archeology , had specific instructions from the <ner:org>British Museum</ner:org> . He was to obtain as many well-preserved artworks as he could while spending the least possible amount of time and money doing so . Interest heightened with each new discovery , and <ner:misc>North American</ner:misc> museums also began to collect <ner:misc>Near Eastern</ner:misc> art . Nothing that emerged from the <ner:misc>Mesopotamian</ner:misc> soi l attracted as much attention as the treasures <ner:per>Leonard Woolley</ner:per> discovered in the 1920s at the <ner:loc>Royal Cemetery</ner:loc> at <ner:loc>Ur</ner:loc> in southern <ner:loc>Mesopotamia</ner:loc> . The interest in the unearthing of lavish third-millennium b.c . Sumerian burials rivaled the public fascination with the 1922 discovery of the <ner:misc>Egyptian</ner:misc> boy-king <ner:misc>Tutankhamen</ner:misc> 's tomb ( see figs . 3-36 to 3-38 ) . The <ner:loc>Ur</ner:loc> cemetery was filled with gold objects , jewelry , artworks , and musical instruments ( figs . 2-8 to 2-11 ) . <ner:loc>Europe</ner:loc> 's royalty and elite frequently visited the site . One of the visitors was the mystery writer <ner:per>Agatha Christie</ner:per> , who later married one of the <ner:misc>British</ner:misc> archeologists working at <ner:loc>Ur</ner:loc> . Her 1936 Murder in <ner:loc>Mesopotamia</ner:loc> centers on an excavation in <ner:loc>Iraq</ner:loc> . The discovery of the treasures of ancient <ner:loc>Ur</ner:loc> put the <ner:misc>Sumerians</ner:misc> once again in a prominent position on the world stage . They had been absent for four thousand years . </ner:content>
