with nearby roads , railways , rivers , and airports , the region boasts the most advanced multi-modal transportation network in the <ner:loc>United States</ner:loc> ; <ner:loc>Mattoon</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Tuscola</ner:loc> are also in close proximity to oil refineries and hydrogen customers who can share in the success of <ner:per>FutureGen</ner:per> ; and <ner:loc>WHEREAS</ner:loc> , The region also contains two major state universities that lead in the fields of geology ; these include the <ner:org>University of Illinois</ner:org> at <ner:loc>Urbana-Cle</ner:loc> below the surface ; and <ner:loc>WHEREAS</ner:loc> , In August of 2006 , the <ner:org>U.S. Department of Energy</ner:org> and the <ner:org>Alliance</ner:org> launched an aggressive schedule for completing an <ner:misc>Environmental Impact Statement</ner:misc> within 12 months ; hearings in <ner:org>Congress</ner:org> raised concerns about costs escalating , due primarily to inflation in construction materials , to $1.5 million ; the total amount was $1.8 million , which included the estimate coal fuel costs for a 4-year test period ; and <ner:loc>WHEREAS</ner:loc> , Between May of 2007 and June of 2007 , the drafted <ner:misc>Environmental Impact Statement</ner:misc> was published by the <ner:org>U.S. Department of Energy</ner:org> , after a month 's delay awaiting federal agency approval , with none of the sites disqualified ; the <ner:org>U.S. Department of Energy</ner:org> held formal public hearings on the <ner:misc>Environmental Impact Statement</ner:misc> on June 26 , 2007 in <ner:loc>Mattoon</ner:loc> and June 28 , 2007 in <ner:loc>Tuscola</ner:loc> , with community supporters turning out in large numbers ;

the <ner:org>U.S. Department of Energy</ner:org> disclosed that its new idea was to pay 100% of the carbon dioxide capture and storage costs , but it would fund nothing for the power side of several gasification facilities being planned by private firms ; this new proposal further delays important technology advances on carbon dioxide capture by at least five years and largely ignores the participation by international members of the <ner:org>Alliance</ner:org> ; and <ner:loc>WHEREAS</ner:loc> , The <ner:org>Alliance</ner:org> , which has a contract with the <ner:org>U.S. Department of Energy</ner:org> extending through June , 15 , 2008 , continues to hold its regular monthly meeting in <ner:loc>Mattoon</ner:loc> ;
