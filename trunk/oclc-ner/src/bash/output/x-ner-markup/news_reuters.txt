[LOC NEW ORLEANS  ] ( [ORG Reuters  ] ) - President [PER George W. Bush  ] heads to storm-battered [LOC Louisiana  ] on Wednesday to survey damage from Hurricane [PER Gustav  ] as tens of thousands who fled [LOC New Orleans  ] prepare to return to a " dark and hot " city struggling to restore power and maintain basic services . 
The visit by [PER Bush  ] , who was widely criticized for a slow response to Hurricane [PER Katrina  ] , is part of an effort by officials to show that they learned the lessons from the 2005 storm that killed 1,500 people and caused $80 billion in damage . 
[PER Bush  ] , who skipped the [ORG Republican National Convention  ] to oversee the response to [PER Gustav  ] , was expected to arrive in [LOC Baton Rouge  ] on Wednesday morning just as residents begin to pour back into the area around [LOC New Orleans  ] . 
Cars and pickup trucks packed with families , bedding , cats and dogs streamed into [ORG Jefferson Parish  ] before dawn , the first evacuees of greater [LOC New Orleans  ] to come home after [PER Gustav  ] . 
Nearly 2 million fled the [LOC Louisiana  ] coast , including some 95 percent of [LOC New Orleans  ] 's residents - an unprecedented exodus credited with saving lives . 
[PER Homemaker Christy Murray  ] spent a month evacuated after [PER Katrina  ] and said authorities handled [PER Gustav  ] much better . 
" It was 100 percent better than [PER Katrina  ] , " she said . 
" There was no chaos this time . 
We were surprised . 
We came right in from [LOC Alabama  ] , straight in this time . 
It was wonderful . 
" 
On Tuesday , [PER Bush  ] declared a major disaster across much of [LOC Louisiana  ] , where most homes and businesses remain without electricity and hospitals running on backup-power are wary of being overrun by returnees . 
[LOC New Orleans  ] Mayor [PER Ray Nagin  ] said residents could return on Thursday , lifting a mandatory evacuation order , while [ORG City Council  ] President [PER Jackie Clarkson  ] warned they would find a city that is " dark and hot . 
" 
" We want you to come into the city , check on your property , make sure that you are comfortable and make an intelligent decision on whether you want to stay in this environment or not , " [PER Nagin  ] told reporters . 
Hurricane [PER Gustav  ] delivered only a glancing blow to [LOC New Orleans  ] and the region 's crucial oil and gas infrastructure when it barreled ashore in [LOC Louisiana  ] on Monday . 
Almost all [LOC U.S.  ] energy production in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] remained shut but producers said they found little damage to refineries and offshore platforms . 
Crude oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday as supply fears eased , trading near five-month lows . 
[PER Gustav  ] also tested a levee system being rebuilt to protect [LOC New Orleans  ] from the kind of deluge that followed [PER Katrina  ] , when protections for the city built below sea level collapsed . 
Although reinforced [LOC New Orleans  ] flood protections will not be finished until 2011 , the levees held up under the pounding from [PER Gustav  ] . 
Water surged over floodwalls and squirted through cracks but the city stayed mainly dry . 
LOW DEATH TOLL 
[LOC Louisiana  ] reported just six deaths in the immediate wake of the storm . 
[LOC New Orleans  ] police also said they had arrested only two people for looting during the storm . 
That was stark contrast to [PER Katrina  ] 's aftermath , when looters roamed the streets and rescue helicopters plucked thousands of people from rooftops and bridges . 
The [ORG Times Picayune  ] , the city 's daily newspaper , said in an editorial on Wednesday that residents were wrong to begin " second-guessing " the urgent call by officials for the large evacuation that peaked during the weekend . 
" The low number of fatalities spoke volumes about the effectiveness of one of the nation 's largest and most efficient evacuations , " the newspaper said in an editorial . 
Meanwhile , [LOC U.S.  ] disaster officials turned their eye to new , dangerous storms churning in the [LOC Atlantic  ] . 
Tropical Storm [PER Hanna  ] was moving through the [LOC Bahamas  ] and threatened the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC East Coast  ] from [LOC Florida  ] to the [LOC Carolinas  ] , and tropical storms [PER Ike  ] and [PER Josephine  ] trekked westward toward the [LOC Caribbean  ] . 
The [ORG Miami-based National Hurricane Center  ] said [PER Hanna  ] was expected to move near the central [LOC Bahamas  ] as it begins to strengthen again toward hurricane force .
