The plebeians and [ORG Senate  ] of [LOC Rome  ] ( in the olden time ) were often at strife with each other concerning the enactment of laws , the cancelling of debts , the division of lands , or the election of magistrates . 
Internal discord did not bring them to blows , however ; these were dissensions merely and contests within the law , which they composed by making mutual concessions , and with much respect for each other . 
Once when the plebeians were going to a war they fell into such a controversy , but they did not use the weapons in their hands , but withdrew to the hill , which from this time on was called the Sacred [PER Mount.2 Even  ] then no violence was done , but they created a magistrate for their protection and called him the tribune of the plebs , to serve especially as a check upon the consuls , who were chosen by the [ORG Senate  ] , so that the political power should not be exclusively in their hands . 
Whence arose still greater bitterness , and the magistrates were arrayed in stronger animosity to each other after this event , and the [ORG Senate  ] and plebeians took sides with them , each believing that it would prevail over the other by augmenting the power of its own magistrates . 
In the midst of contests of this kind [PER Marcius Coriolanus  ] , having been banished contrary to justice , took refuge with the [LOC Volsci  ] and levied war against his country . 
This is the only case of armed strife that can be found in the ancient seditions , and this was caused by an exile . 
The sword was never carried into the assembly , and there was no civil butchery until [PER Tiberius Gracchus  ] , while serving as tribune and bringing forward new laws , was the first to fall a victim to internal commotion ; and many others besides , who were assembled with him at the [LOC Capitol  ] , were slain around the temple . 
Sedition did not end with this abominable deed . 
Repeatedly the parties came into open conflict , often carrying daggers ; and occasionally in the temples , or the assemblies , or the forum , some one serving as tribune , or prætor , or consul , or a candidate for those offices , or some person otherwise distinguished , would be slain . 
Unseemly violence prevailed almost constantly , together with shameful contempt for law and justice . 
As the evil gained in magnitude open insurrections against the government and large warlike expeditions against the country were undertaken by exiles , or criminals , or persons contending against each other for some office or military command . 
There were chiefs of factions in different places aspiring to supreme power , some of them refusing to disband the troops intrusted to them by the people , others levying forces against each other on their own account , without public authority . 
Whichever of them first got possession of the city , the others made war nominally against their adversaries , but actually against their country . 
They assailed it like a foreign enemy . 
Ruthless and indiscriminate massacres of citizens were perpetrated . 
Men were proscribed , others banished , property was confiscated , and some were even subjected to excruciating tortures . 
No unseemly deed was wanting until , about fifty years after the death of [PER Gracchus  ] , [PER Cornelius Sulla  ] , one of these chiefs of factions , doctoring one evil with another , made himself the absolute master of the state for an indefinite period . 
Such officials were formerly called dictators – an office created in the most perilous emergencies for six months only , and long since fallen into disuse . 
[PER Sulla  ] , although nominally elected , became dictator for life by force and compulsion . 
Nevertheless he became satiated with power and was the first man , so far as I know , holding supreme power , who had the courage to lay it down voluntarily and to declare that he would render an account of his stewardship to any who were dissatisfied with it . 
And so , for a considerable period , he walked to the forum as a private citizen in the sight of all and returned home unmolested , so great was the awe of his government still remaining in the minds of the onlookers , or their amazement at his laying it down . 
Perhaps they were ashamed to call for an accounting , or entertained other good feeling toward him , or a belief that his despotism had been beneficial to the state . 
Thus there was a cessation of factions for a short time while [PER Sulla  ] lived , and a compensation for the evils which [PER Sulla  ] had wrought . 
After his death the troubles broke out afresh and continued until [PER Gaius Cæsar  ] , who had held the command in [LOC Gaul  ] by election for some years , was ordered by the [ORG Senate  ] to lay down his command . 
He charged that it was not the wish of the [ORG Senate  ] , but of [PER Pompey  ] , his enemy , who had command of an army in [LOC Italy  ] , and was scheming to depose him . 
So he sent a proposal that both should retain their armies , so that neither need fear the other 's enmity , or that [PER Pompey  ] should dismiss his forces also and live as a private citizen under the laws in like manner with him-self . 
Both requests being refused , he marched from [LOC Gaul  ] against [PER Pompey  ] in the [MISC Roman  ] territory , entered it , put him to flight , pursued him into [LOC Thessaly  ] , won a brilliant victory over him in a great battle , and followed him to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
After [PER Pompey  ] had been slain by the [MISC Egyptians  ] [PER Cæsar  ] set to work on the affairs of [LOC Egypt  ] and remained there until he had settled the dynasty of that country . 
Then he returned to [LOC Rome  ] . 
Having overpowered by war his principal rival , who had been surnamed the Great on account of his brilliant military exploits , he now ruled without disguise , nobody daring any longer to dispute him about anything , and was chosen , next after [PER Sulla  ] , dictator for life . 
Again all civil dissensions ceased until [ORG Brutus  ] and [ORG Cassius  ] , envious of his great power and desiring to restore the government of their fathers , slew in the [ORG Senate  ] this most popular man , who was also the one most experienced in the art of government . 
The people mourned for him greatly . 
They scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers . 
They buried him in the middle of the forum and built a temple on the place of his funeral pile , and offered sacrifice to him as a god . 
And now civil discord broke out again worse than ever and increased enormously . 
[LOC Massacres  ] , banishments , and proscriptions of both senators and the so-called knights took place straightway , including great numbers of both classes , the chief of factions surrendering their enemies to each other , and for this purpose not sparing even their friends and brothers ; so much does animosity toward rivals overpower the love of kindred . 
So in td the only one wanting to complete the [MISC Roman  ] empire as it now stands . 
In consequence of these exploits he was at once elevated to the rank of a deity while still living , and was the first to be thus distinguished by the [MISC Romans  ] , and was called by them [PER Augustus  ] . 
He assumed to himself an authority like [PER Cæsar  ] 's over the country and the subject nations , and even greater than [PER Cæsar  ] 's , not needing any form of election , or authorization , or even the pretence of it . 
His government being strengthened by time and mastery , and himself successful in all things and revered by all , he left a lineage and succession that held the supreme power in like manner after him . 
Thus , out of multifarious civil commotions , the [MISC Roman  ] state passed into solidarity and monarchy . 
To show how these things came about I have written and compiled piled this narrative , which is well worth the study of those who wish to know the measureless ambition of men , their dreadful lust of power , their unwearying perseverance , and the countless forms of evil . 
It is especially necessary for me to describe these things beforehand since they are the preliminaries of my [MISC Egyptian  ] history , and end where that begins , for [LOC Egypt  ] was seized in consequence of this last civil commotion , [PER Cleopatra  ] having joined forces with [PER Antony  ] . 
On account of its magnitude I have divided the work , first taking up the events that occurred from the time of [PER Sempronius Gracchus  ] to that of [PER Cornelius Sulla  ] ; next , those that followed to the death of [PER Cæsar  ] . 
The remaining books of the civil wars treat of those waged by the triumvirs against each other and the [MISC Roman  ] people , until the end of these conflicts , and the greatest achievement , the battle of [LOC Actium  ] , fought by [PER Octavius Cæsar  ] against [PER Antony  ] and [PER Cleopatra  ] together , which will be the beginning of the [MISC Egyptian  ] history .
