[LOC WHEREAS  ] , [PER FutureGen  ] will greatly benefit industries involved in mining , transportation , and the use of 11 February 21 , 2008 coal ; these are industries that currently employ thousands of people across the State ; [PER FutureGen  ] will also create jobs ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] estimated that [PER FutureGen  ] would create approximately 1,300 construction jobs and 150 permanent jobs ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , During the four-year construction period , there would be more than $1 billion in economic impact statewide ; approximately 1,225 indirect spin-off jobs will be created as a result of the ripple effect generated by [PER FutureGen  ] ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , The [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] announced plans to build [PER FutureGen  ] in 2003 ; in July 2006 , the [ORG FutureGen Alliance  ] announced the 2 finalists for the facility in [LOC Illinois: Mattoon  ] and [LOC Tuscola  ] ; the [PER FutureGen  ] plant will be a medium-sized , coal-fueled plant , generating approximately 275 megawatts of electricity , enough to supply approximately 150,000 [LOC U.S.  ] households ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , [LOC Mattoon  ] and [LOC Tuscola  ] are located in east central [LOC Illinois  ] and are equidistant from [LOC Chicago  ] , [LOC St. Louis  ] , and [LOC Indianapolis  ] ; with nearby roads , railways , rivers , and airports , the region boasts the most advanced multi-modal transportation network in the [LOC United States  ] ; [LOC Mattoon  ] and [LOC Tuscola  ] are also in close proximity to oil refineries and hydrogen customers who can share in the success of [PER FutureGen  ] ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , The region also contains two major state universities that lead in the fields of geology ; these include the [ORG University of Illinois  ] at [LOC Urbana-Cle  ] below the surface ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , In August of 2006 , the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] and the [ORG Alliance  ] launched an aggressive schedule for completing an [MISC Environmental Impact Statement  ] within 12 months ; hearings in [ORG Congress  ] raised concerns about costs escalating , due primarily to inflation in construction materials , to $1.5 million ; the total amount was $1.8 million , which included the estimate coal fuel costs for a 4-year test period ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , Between May of 2007 and June of 2007 , the drafted [MISC Environmental Impact Statement  ] was published by the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] , after a month 's delay awaiting federal agency approval , with none of the sites disqualified ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] held formal public hearings on the [MISC Environmental Impact Statement  ] on June 26 , 2007 in [LOC Mattoon  ] and June 28 , 2007 in [LOC Tuscola  ] , with community supporters turning out in large numbers ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , Between June of 2007 and July of 2007 , the [ORG Illinois General Assembly  ] gives overwhelming support to [ORG Senate Bill  ] 1704 ; this bill created the [ORG Clean Coal FutureGen  ] for [ORG Illinois Act for the  ] purpose of providing the [ORG FutureGen Alliance  ] with adequate liability protection , land use rights , and permitting certainty to facilitate the [ORG FutureGen Project  ] in [LOC Illinois  ] ; the bill was signed into law on July 30 , 2007 ; and

[LOC WHEREAS  ] , In September of 2007 , an [LOC Illinois  ] team met with the [ORG Alliance  ] in [ORG Edwardsville  ] to defend and clarify final offer issues ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] still had not decided on the location for the plant ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , Between October of 2007 and November of 2007 , letters supporting the State 's bid from all major coal producing states , representing 75% of the nation 's tonnage , were forwarded to the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On November 17 , 2007 , the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] published a final Environmental February 21 , 2008 12 Impact Statement ; this started the 30-day clock for a formal decision to be made regarding the location of the plant ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On December 4 , 2007 , the [ORG Alliance Board of Directors  ] , meeting in [LOC Washington D.C.  ] , made a final site selection decision , but it was kept confidential ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] issued a letter at that time urging the [ORG Alliance  ] to delay announcing the final site ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On December 18 , 2007 , at a news conference in [LOC Washington D.C.  ] , the [ORG Alliance  ] announced [LOC Mattoon  ] was the unanimous choice to host [ORG FutureGen  ] ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] issued a statement that it plans to re-scope the [MISC FutureGen  ] project after more than $40 million has already been spent ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On January 10 , 2008 , by letter , the [ORG Alliance  ] made a counteroffer to take on a larger share of future cost escalation and , through negotiations over the assets of the project , repay the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On January 16 , 2008 , it was disclosed that the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] will abandon [PER FutureGen  ] in favor of re-allocating the funds through a new solicitation of interest to assist with multiple power plant projects ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , On January 29 , 2008 , it was disclosed to members of [LOC Illinois  ] delegation that [ORG FutureGen  ] will be cancelled and a new [ORG FutureGen Program  ] will take its place ; the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] disclosed that its new idea was to pay 100% of the carbon dioxide capture and storage costs , but it would fund nothing for the power side of several gasification facilities being planned by private firms ; this new proposal further delays important technology advances on carbon dioxide capture by at least five years and largely ignores the participation by international members of the [ORG Alliance  ] ; and 
[LOC WHEREAS  ] , The [ORG Alliance  ] , which has a contract with the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] extending through June , 15 , 2008 , continues to hold its regular monthly meeting in [LOC Mattoon  ] ; and

RESOLVED , BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NINETY-FIFTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF [LOC ILLINOIS  ] , that we urge the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] and the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] to make any changes necessary to reverse the decision that resulted in the dismantling and abandonment of [ORG FutureGen  ] ; and be it further 
RESOLVED , That the commitment is kept for all the researchers , private-sector supporters , and public officials and , most importantly , the people of [LOC Central Illinois  ] who have worked to bring this landmark project to fruition ; and be it further 
RESOLVED , That suitable copies of this resolution be delivered to the Majority Leader of the [ORG U.S. Senate  ] , the Speaker of the [ORG U.S. House of Representatives  ] , the members of the [ORG Illinois Congressional  ] delegation , and the Secretary of the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] .
