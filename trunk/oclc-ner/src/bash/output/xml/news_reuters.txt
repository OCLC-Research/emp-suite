<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner"><ner:per>Bush</ner:per> surveys <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> damage as evacuees stream home Wed Sep 3 , 2008 10:34am EDT By <ner:per>Tim Gaynor</ner:per> <ner:loc>NEW ORLEANS</ner:loc> ( <ner:org>Reuters</ner:org> ) - President <ner:per>George W. Bush</ner:per> heads to storm-battered <ner:loc>Louisiana</ner:loc> on Wednesday to survey damage from Hurricane <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> as tens of thousands who fled <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> prepare to return to a " dark and hot " city struggling to restore power and maintain basic services . The visit by <ner:per>Bush</ner:per> , who was widely criticized for a slow response to Hurricane <ner:per>Katrina</ner:per> , is part of an effort by officials to show that they learned the lessons from the 2005 storm that killed 1,500 people and caused $80 billion in damage . <ner:per>Bush</ner:per> , who skipped the <ner:org>Republican National Convention</ner:org> to oversee the response to <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> , was expected to arrive in <ner:loc>Baton Rouge</ner:loc> on Wednesday morning just as residents begin to pour back into the area around <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> . Cars and pickup trucks packed with families , bedding , cats and dogs streamed into <ner:org>Jefferson Parish</ner:org> before dawn , the first evacuees of greater <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> to come home after <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> . Nearly 2 million fled the <ner:loc>Louisiana</ner:loc> coast , including some 95 percent of <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> 's residents - an unprecedented exodus credited with saving lives . <ner:per>Homemaker Christy Murray</ner:per> spent a month evacuated after <ner:per>Katrina</ner:per> and said authorities handled <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> much better . " It was 100 percent better than <ner:per>Katrina</ner:per> , " she said . " There was no chaos this time . We were surprised . We came right in from <ner:loc>Alabama</ner:loc> , straight in this time . It was wonderful . " On Tuesday , <ner:per>Bush</ner:per> declared a major disaster across much of <ner:loc>Louisiana</ner:loc> , where most homes and businesses remain without electricity and hospitals running on backup-power are wary of being overrun by returnees . <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> Mayor <ner:per>Ray Nagin</ner:per> said residents could return on Thursday , lifting a mandatory evacuation order , while <ner:org>City Council</ner:org> President <ner:per>Jackie Clarkson</ner:per> warned they would find a city that is " dark and hot . " " We want you to come into the city , check on your property , make sure that you are comfortable and make an intelligent decision on whether you want to stay in this environment or not , " <ner:per>Nagin</ner:per> told reporters . Hurricane <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> delivered only a glancing blow to <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> and the region 's crucial oil and gas infrastructure when it barreled ashore in <ner:loc>Louisiana</ner:loc> on Monday . Almost all <ner:loc>U.S.</ner:loc> energy production in the <ner:loc>Gulf</ner:loc> of <ner:loc>Mexico</ner:loc> remained shut but producers said they found little damage to refineries and offshore platforms . Crude oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday as supply fears eased , trading near five-month lows . <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> also tested a levee system being rebuilt to protect <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> from the kind of deluge that followed <ner:per>Katrina</ner:per> , when protections for the city built below sea level collapsed . Although reinforced <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> flood protections will not be finished until 2011 , the levees held up under the pounding from <ner:per>Gustav</ner:per> . Water surged over floodwalls and squirted through cracks but the city stayed mainly dry . LOW DEATH TOLL <ner:loc>Louisiana</ner:loc> reported just six deaths in the immediate wake of the storm . <ner:loc>New Orleans</ner:loc> police also said they had arrested only two people for looting during the storm . That was stark contrast to <ner:per>Katrina</ner:per> 's aftermath , when looters roamed the streets and rescue helicopters plucked thousands of people from rooftops and bridges . The <ner:org>Times Picayune</ner:org> , the city 's daily newspaper , said in an editorial on Wednesday that residents were wrong to begin " second-guessing " the urgent call by officials for the large evacuation that peaked during the weekend . " The low number of fatalities spoke volumes about the effectiveness of one of the nation 's largest and most efficient evacuations , " the newspaper said in an editorial . Meanwhile , <ner:loc>U.S.</ner:loc> disaster officials turned their eye to new , dangerous storms churning in the <ner:loc>Atlantic</ner:loc> . Tropical Storm <ner:per>Hanna</ner:per> was moving through the <ner:loc>Bahamas</ner:loc> and threatened the <ner:loc>U.S.</ner:loc> <ner:misc>East Coast</ner:misc> from <ner:loc>Florida</ner:loc> to the <ner:loc>Carolinas</ner:loc> , and tropical storms <ner:per>Ike</ner:per> and <ner:per>Josephine</ner:per> trekked westward toward the <ner:loc>Caribbean</ner:loc> . The <ner:org>Miami-based National Hurricane Center</ner:org> said <ner:per>Hanna</ner:per> was expected to move near the central <ner:loc>Bahamas</ner:loc> as it begins to strengthen again toward hurricane force .
