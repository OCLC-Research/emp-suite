                --------/ Plackup - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plack/
                --------/ Web browser
                        --------/ Opera 10.10 - best results
                        --------/ Firefox 3.6.3
                        --------/ Internet Explorer 8
        --------/ Configuration
                --------/ Open app.yml, change the directory option under setup.
                --------/ Point it to a directory on your system that contains files you want to tag.
        --------/ Usage
                --------/ To start the web-app, run 'plackup' in this directory
                --------/ By default, it starts a server on port 5000, so point your browser to http://localhost:5000/
                --------/ Select a file from the list displayed.
                --------/ Select text in the file you want to tag. 
                        --------/ In Opera, you can type 'p' to tag the selected text as PER, 'm' for MISC, 'o' for ORG, and 'l' for LOC
                                --------/ Typing 'c' will clear the tagging for selected text. It's best to select text at word boundaries,
                                --------/ and to select a few words on either side when clearing a tag.
                        --------/ In other browsers (and Opera) click on the tag type in the legend to change the tag.
                        --------/ You can delete selected text from the page by clicking on 'Delete' (pressing 'd' in Opera)
                                --------/ This can be useful when another tagging tool adds space characters.
                --------/ Clicking on 'As CONLL' will show the text as it looks in CONLL.
                --------/ Clicking on 'As HTML' will show the color-ized version of the tagging.
                --------/ To save the CONLL tagged version, you must click on 'As CONLL' and then manually copy and paste the text into a file.

                --------/ Move the downloaded zip file into the uiuc-ner directory.
                --------/ Execute the 'make-deploy' script.
                        --------/ This script will unzip the file, patch the source, compile the classes,

        --------/ Usage
                --------/ In src/bash there are a few demonstration scripts.
                --------/ ner.server
                        --------/ This script starts an NER web service. It can take several minutes to fully initialize.

                        --------/ It will tag the sample texts in the input subdirectory, putting the results in the output subdirectory.
                        --------/ There are four output format options: text/x-ner-markup, text/x-ner-entities, text/html, and application/xml

                                --------/ Depending on your training-gold data and the data on which you intend to use the model, this can
                                --------/ result in subtle differences in your model's performance. It's best to experiment with each value.

                                --------/ the time it takes to train a model increase. 30 rounds and 500k of training data can take
                                --------/ several hours, but produces good results. 3 is the default here just for the sample.
        --------/ Usage
                --------/ Make a copy of the "skeleton" directory for each model you want to train.
                --------/ e.g., cp -r skeleton model.one
                --------/ To build the sample model, just execute the 'train' script from the model.one directory.
                --------/ To build your own model, copy your training-gold data into the model.one/data directory
                --------/ and make sure all the configuration settings above are set accordingly. Then execute the 'train' script.
