found a reference to " plasticity " in the [MISC MCGRAW-HILL DICTIONARY OF ART] ([LOC New York]: [ORG McGraw-Hill], 1969), Vol. 
4, p. 
390-391: 
" PLASTICITY. 
That quality of a work of art which conveys a sense of tangible, sculptured volume. 
Although it is basic to sculpture, plasticity can be deliberately de-emphasized in that medium, as it can be strongly suggested in painting. 
The term was first applied to the analysis of art by. 
" 
This may give you a place to begin.To get an idea of the many meanings for this word and their origins, try looking at the definitions in the [ORG OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY] ([ORG OED]), a reference source that gives a word 's etymology (or historical uses and contexts). 
This approach should help clarify the particular definition you wish to target; check your local public or university library for the availability of the [ORG OED]. 
Of course, plastic is a medium: you might try tracking when it was first used as a medium, since this would give you a sense of when the word became an adjective or an adverb.

The demand for art is reviving following a cataclysmic crash in 1990, when prices overall fell by over 60 percent in six months. 
Although art values have been recovering by about 10 percent annually, beginners and collectors on a budget can still buy a large number of pieces at 50 percent or so below what they sold for at the market 's 1989 peak. 
Growing demand has also increased the chances of being sold second-rate works or outright fakes, however.

Perhaps this entry on aesthetics from the [MISC MCGRAW HILL DICTIONARY OF ART]  ([LOC New York], [LOC NY]: [ORG McGraw-Hill], 1969) will be of assistance: 
" aesthetics (Esthetics). 
That branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of beauty and its relation to the perceiver or beholder, especially as applied to the fine arts. 
While beauty is the quality of a given object or form felt by the beholder in viewing it, aesthetics is the organization of concepts and ideas relating to this quality of beauty. 
As a philosophical concern in the Western world, aesthetics goes back at least to [PER Plato], [PER Aristotle], and Plotinus in classical antiquity, although it is important to note that there are long-established aesthetic systems in [LOC China], [LOC India], the Near East, and other non-Western areas. 
Classical aesthetics as organized by [PER Plato] and his successors revolved around the idea of art as a form of imitation of reality (mimesis). 
This view was retained with relatively little alteration during the Middle Ages and Renaissance and only gradually, that is, from the 17th century on, did the idea of art as inspiration acquire importance. 
The term aesthetics was popularized by [PER Hegel] 's Aesthetik (based on his 1820-30 lectures but published posthumously); the pursuit of aesthetics as a systematic and specialized study dates only from the second half of the 19th century. it coincided at that point with the European artists' concern with external appearances-the painters' response to the materialistic milieu of that period. 
Harking back to [PER Plato] and [PER Aristotle], 19th-century artists, such as [PER Courbet, Manet], and even [PER Cezanne], viewed art as imitation. 
Since that time there has been a shift; with [PER Gauguin] and the symbolists came again the idea of art as a subjective and personal expression of the artist himself. 
The term aesthetics has been broadened by the American Society for aesthetics (Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism , founded in 1941) to include all studies of the arts and related experiences from all viewpoints-historical, educational, psychological, and so on.

Also, the following book may prove helpful: 
[PER Mondale, Joan]. 
POLITICS IN ART ([LOC Minneapolis], [ORG Lerner Publications], 1972) 
For example, [PER Joan Mondale] says in her book (POLITICS IN ART, p. 
28): 
" American artists have often used their art to comment on the conditions of human life. 
The problems of unemployment, poverty, emotional deprivation, and loneliness are of concern to politicians. 
Some of the most eloquent and enduring protests to [LOC America] 's social problems have come from artists, and their works have helped dramatize the need for change and improvement. 
" 
As an example, I have included [PER Mondale] 's description of [PER Reginald Marsh] 's work " The Bread Line, " which is in the collection of the Library of Congress: [ POLITICS IN ART, p. 
29] 
" Unemployment was widespread during the Great Depression in the 1930s. 
Millions were out of work, from the bank president to the janitor. 
And to stay alive, men stood in lines waiting for handouts of bread and other food. 
In THE BREAD LINE, which he drew for a magazine, artist [PER Reginald Marsh] shows the sadness of these men who have lost their pride and dignity because they cannot find jobs. 
He captured for all time the great cost, in human terms, of widespread unemployment. 
[PER Marsh], who painted as well as sketched, believed that artists should show all sides of life. 
He created art that showed misery and despair, in the hope that it would result in action to improve people 's lives. 
Many artists were among the unemployed during the Depression, but some of them made a living working on the [ORG Federal Art Project]. 
The government gave these artists their materials, a place to work, and a paycheck every week. 
[PER Ben Shahn], [PER Philip Evergood], and some of the other artists represented in this book thus were able to paint full time and develop their talent during the Depression. 
They did not have to give up their art to work at something else in order to eat. 
Like [PER Marsh], these artists boldly pointed out the wrongs in our society. 
Today many of their paintings hang in government buildings in [LOC Washington], [LOC D.C.], and other cities.

Your topic is interesting but extremely broad. 
A great deal of information has been written on the relationship between art and technology. 
Regrettably, this... reference service cannot provide the essay length answer you need, as the purpose is to provide brief answers based upon factual information found in authoritative resources. 
However, let me get you started on your research by suggesting general resources on this subject. 
You can track the following books and articles through your local public or university library. 
If your library doesn't carry these publications, ask a librarian if they can be ordered through inter-library loan.

Abstract [ from ART ABSTRACTS]: 
" The writer discusses the impact of electronic photography on our regard and its destabilization of accepted notions of objectivity, use, meaning, and context. 
Many images today seem to be photorealistic but are created with digital cameras or by manipulating information in computer programs. 
In such a situation, the indexical relation between a sign and a referent can no longer be assumed. 
This was made clear when artist [PER Tina Barney] reconceived a 'nostalgic' moment from her childhood by electronically manipulating a photograph to include doubles of her sister. 
Other artists have used digital imaging to address topics such as identity and coming of age ([PER Ellen Brooks]) and to erode further the distinct boundaries between fine art and the cultural object (Suky Best).

" [MISC Photography at the crossroads: the coexistence of chemical and digital processes] " by [PER Michael Ensdorf] EXPOSURE. 
Vol. 
32, no. 
2 (1999): 45-49. 
Abstract [ from ART ABSTRACTS]: 
" The writer discusses the impact of digital photography on studying photography in the classroom. 
The technological changes occurring within photography, he asserts, have altered and redirected traditional methods of teaching that have formed the basis of photographic education for most of the last 40 years. 
He argues that there needs to be a coexistence between the methodologies of traditional photography and digital processes that takes into account the creative needs and wants of contemporary students. 
The writer goes on to discuss how the merging or replacement of camera technologies with the computer has an impact not just on methods of making images but also in the processes of learning, and he analyzes the technological ramifications of teaching digital photography in the classroom.

This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
1) " Computer Art 
Term formerly used to describe any work of art in which a computer was used to make either the work itself or the decisions that determined its form. 
Computers became so widely used, however, that in the late 20th century the term was applied mainly to work that emphasized the computer 's role.... developed a sophisticated programme, AARON, which generated drawings that the artist then completed as coloured paintings. 
Until c. 
1980 graphic output was relatively slow:... 
It eventually became possible for artists to work interactively in real time with a display screen, using a 'light pen' or stylus... 
By the 1990s personal computers could perform tasks that once required large, expensive items of hardware, while computer skills became a standard element in art and design education.... 
" 
2) " Science and art, §2: Ways in which scientific knowledge has affected art (v) Use of technology as new media. 
The most spectacular instance of a new technology providing a new artistic medium is Photography, not only in itself but also by its extension into film, television, video, photocopying and fax.... 
A number of the technologies characteristic of the 20th century have been exploited by artists attracted by the fresh visual possibilities and motivated by a sense that the visual arts should be responsive to modern developments.... 
One of the most visually seductive is holography (see Hologram), which uses a system of intersecting lasers to achieve compelling illusions of objects existing in full three dimensions and responding to movements in the spectator 's viewpoint as if real.... 
Some remarkable graphic patterns were created by mathematicians investigating the theory of chaos.... 
.... 
The creation of 'virtual reality', in which not just the visual but the complete sensory simulation of an environment can be evoked, was another burgeoning area of computer science of interest to the artist at the end of the 20th century.

The following information was excerpted from a much longer article in [MISC GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com [ January 2004 access requires account]) about Pre-Columbian art in [LOC South America].

“South [LOC America], Pre-Columbian, §I: Introduction 
4. 
Craftsmen and artists. 
Early Spanish chroniclers recorded that in Inca society artisans were full-time artists and craft specialists who worked directly for the ruler. 
They were known by professional titles (e.g. tapestry-weaver) and supported by the state, which also provided their tools and equipment. 
Mundane articles, such as garments, everyday pottery and dwellings, were made by those who used them. 
Fine objects were created by specialists for the ruler—the only true patron of the arts—and symbolized his semi-divine majesty and that of his state. 
Art represented political power and religious force in this world and the next. ‘The fine handicraft they have produced arouses the admiration of all who know it. 
It is amazing how few tools they have for their work and how easily they produce things of the finest quality’, wrote the Spaniard [PER Pedro de Cieza de León] in the 16th century. 
The Inca transferred from one place to another groups known as mitimaes, who provided silversmiths, stone-carvers and other specialists. 
[PER Cieza] wrote that the mitimaes were valued next to the highest nobility. 
Craftsmen produced what was required, and their labour was a form of tribute in a state in which everyone paid some kind of taxation. 
Apprenticeship must have started at an early age, for [PER Cieza] describes young children who could make fine, uniform silver beads. …”

Listings of articles in art magazines, indexes to auction sales, who 's whos, the museum library 's extensive pamphlet files, specialized sources on Mexican and Latino art, and the Web were searched, but no references were found to an artist by this name. 
[MISC Davenport's Art Reference & Price Guide, 2001/ 2002] by [PER R. J. Davenport] ([LOC Phoenix]: [ORG Gordon 's Art Reference], 2002) has the following brief entry on a Portuguese artist named [PER Alfred Santos], and I wonder if the patron might be referring to him: 
" [PER Santos, Alfred Nunes] * 19th century * [LOC Portugal] * Painter " 
Is the patron certain of the spelling of the artist 's name ? 
In what context did they encounter the name (at a museum, in a book, etc. ? 
Does the patron know if the artist is alive or deceased ? 
Is the patron certain that the artist is Mexican? 
Despite the growing emphasis on technology in various art fields, there is still a need for individuals with drawing and drafting skills, who are familiar with traditional art techniques and materials. 
First, you might want to look at THE OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK, which is a publication of the [ORG Bureau of Labor Statistics], and available online (http://www.bls.gov/oco/ [ July 2003]). 
It provides descriptions of careers (education requirements, job outlook, salary, etc. 
) which might help give you an idea of directions that someone with good drawing abilities can take. 
To view the career listing for artists, go to the OOH website at http://www.bls.gov/oco/ [ July 2003], then click on " Professional and Related Service " from the list in blue on the right side of the page, then scroll down the page until you see " Artists and related workers " under the category of Arts and Design.

According to [PER Lloyd Goodrich] 's book [MISC Winslow Homer], " We know very little about [PER Homer] 's ideas on art. 
Few statements on art by him were recorded, and they were mostly about his subjects or purely representational problems. 
" (p. 
19). 
However, [PER James Thomas Flexner], in his The World of [PER Winslow Homer] 1836-1910, claims that Country School represents [PER Homer] 's attitude towards school. 
The brilliant sunlight and the bored or distracted expressions of the teacher and students suggest that nature is the true source of beauty and meaning (p. 
29). 
I could not find anything that discussed the influences of other artists on this particular work or even [PER Homer] 's 1870 's period in general. 
The Dictionary of Art entry on [PER Homer] came closest but was still more general than what this client is asking for.

In addition, the following excerpts are quotations for various reviews of her shows indicating the critical reception of her work. 
1) On October 6, 2000, [PER Ken Johnson] reviewed an April Gornik show at the [ORG Edward Thorpe Gallery] in [LOC New York] in [ORG THE NEW YORK TIMES]: 
" April Gornik continues to combine 19th-century Transcendentalism and 30th-century Modernism in the production of expansive, dreamlike landscapes Ms. Gornik paints to a simplifying, almost primitive way, giving her canvases a flattened immediacy that marks them as modern At the same time, archetypal, often symmetrical images of unpeopled nature evoke the pantheistic mysticism of Emerson or the Lummist vision of [PER Martin Johnson Heade] 
At best modernist optical intensity goes hand in hand with divine immanence, as in " Mirror Forest, " in which greenish sunlight pours meltingly through a grove of young trees, the parallel trunks of which spread out evenly across the eightfoot-wide canvas. 
Other pictures lack such radiance but still project moods of lonesome euphoria. 
In " The Wave " a distant burst of foam on the seam between Color Fieldlike stretches of blue sky and aqua green water is like an oracular sign to the solitary wanderer. 
In " [LOC Cloud Lake] " a heavy gray cloud is mirrored m dark, tree-rimmed water below, reflecting, perhaps, the viewer 's own spiritual division between surface and depth. 
Not all Ms Gornik 's pictures are equally captivating. 
" Underwater " looks like a scuba diving photograph from a travel magazine, and her charcoal drawings are thin Nevertheless, this show as a whole casts a soulful spell. 
" 
2) A more recent review of April Gornik 's show at [ORG Danese Gallery] in [LOC New York] by [PER Edward Leffingwell] in ART IN AMERICA (Vol. 
90, No. 4 (April, 2002)) has the following response to her work: 
" The reality of April Gornik 's satisfying pieces, which are on display at [LOC New York] 's [ORG Danese Gallery], lies in their persuasiveness as representations. 
Gornik 's recent collection of idealized small paintings are pure ruses, flawless surfaces of oil on linen that deliberately bring to mind the transcendent luminosity of [PER John Frederick Kensett], [PER Frederic Church], and [PER Martin Johnson Heade] and the lonely landscapes of [PER Caspar David Friedrich]. 
" 
3) [PER Ann Landi], writing about the same show in ARTNEWS (Vol. 
101, No. 2 (February, 2002)), writes: 
" All the works in a show of April Gornik 's pieces at Danese are infused with the strange emptiness that has become her trademark. 
Gornik 's landscapes have always occupied a difficult terrain located somewhere between boffo illustration, magic realism, and O'Keeffe-like abstraction. 
The exhibition featured ten paintings and six large drawings, all done in 2001: The paintings evoke icy fjords, desolate tropical islands, booming skies, and flooded marshes and riverbanks. 
"

searched listings of exhibiting artists, indexes to articles in art magazines, indexes to auction sales, who 's who, the museum library 's extensive pamphlet files, and the Web, but unfortunately found no biographical information on this artist other than the fact that he worked with the [ORG Works Progress Administration] 's [ORG Federal Art Project] during the Depression. 
I also found brief information on the [ORG Smithsonian American Art Museum] 's website: 
From a November 12, 1997 press release for the exhibition TIME OUT ! 
SPORTS IN ART: "...Joseph Rugolo painted his 'Mural of Sports' about 1935 while in the mural division of the federally sponsored [ORG Works Progress Administration] in [LOC New York City], where it originally was displayed in the [ORG Theodore Roosevelt High School]. 
The artist identified the runner as Olympian [PER Jesse Owens] and the tennis player as [PER Helen Wills Moody Roark].... 
" 
The [ORG Works Progress Administration] ([ORG WPA]) and its [ORG Federal Art Project] were important supporters of the arts during the Depression. 
The following entry describing the project is from the [ORG ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN ART]. 
([LOC New York]:[ORG E.P. Dutton], 1981), p. 
606.: 
" [ORG WPA] ([ORG Works Progress Administration]) [ORG Federal Art Project]. 
An experimental program established in December, 1933, by President [PER F. D. Roosevelt] to help artists caught in the economic doldrums of the Great Depression. 
The [ORG Public Works of Art Project], as it was called, employed almost four thousand artists during its brief existence.... some fifteen thousand works, at a total cost to the government of $1,312,177;... 
This experiment ended in June, 1934, but the administration was encouraged by its success, and shortly two major agencies were created to take over and expand the work of the [ORG PWAP]. 
The first of these was the Section of Painting and Sculpture of the [ORG Treasury Department], established in October, 1934.... 
Meanwhile, in May of 1935, the [ORG Works Progress Adminstration] [ Ed: Administration] was formed under [PER Harry Hopkins]. 
Part of its program was the establishment of projects for the employment of artists, musicians, writers, and actors. 
The [ORG Federal Art Project],... 
From its establishment to its dissolution in 1943, the [ORG Federal Art Project] employed five thousand artists... 
The largest section of the FAP was the easel division.... 
The project provided a magnificent opportunity for painters like [PER Stuart Davis], *[PER Ben Shahn], * [PER Arshile Gorky], * [PER Jackson Pollock], * and many others to develop their styles.... 
One of the most important aspects of the [ORG Federal Art Project] was the Index of American Design, which recorded the history of decorative and applied art in [LOC America] in a series of twenty thousand plates.... historic archive... is now preserved at the [ORG National Gallery of Art] in [LOC Washington], [LOC D.C]. 
In 1939 the [ORG WPA] art projects came under criticism from both the press and [ORG Congress] because of a fear of subversive propaganda from a program offering its artists total freedom of expression.... 
In assessing the achievement of the effort of the [ORG Roosevelt Administration] to assist the American artist, a clear distinction should be made between the work done under the [ORG Treasury Department] and that done under the [ORG Works Progress Administration] or, as it was later called, the [ORG Works Projects Administration]. 
The major weakness of both was that they were less concerned with the creation of art than with providing employment for needy artists.... 
The Treasury concentrated on murals, whereas the [ORG WPA] 's major emphases were on easel painting and the [misc Index of American Design].

The purpose of the library is to provide brief answers based upon factual information found in authoritative resources. 
We do not provide personal opinions. 
However, while you don't indicate what sort of animation is of interest to you, the term is discussed in several publications on art and art terms, which would imply that animation is considered at least a form of art or creative expression. 
For example, the following definition is from THE GLOSSARY OF ART, ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN SINCE 1945 by [PER John A. Walker] ([LOC Boston]:[ORG G. K. Hall], 1991): 
" animation: Today several different kinds of animated films and 
videos exist: short cartoons and personal statements, full-length teatures made for cinema-goers, educational and training films, TV commercials and programme titles, rock music videos. 
The prime aim of the art of animation is to render movement via a sequence of still images - usually drawings - which are then photographed on to film and a sound-track added.... 
Animation is extremely costly, labour-intensive and time-consuming because of the huge amount of hand-work involved. 
Exactly what impact computer graphic machines and laser discs will have on the processes and economics of animation in the future remains unclear. 
Animated films can be abstract or figurative;... 
As a technique, animation developed in the late nineteenth century and reached a high point of popular appeal in the 1930s and '40s with the cartoons and feature-length films of the [PER Walt Disney Studio...]. 
Arguably, animation is virtually unique in its conjunction of traditional artistic skills (drawing, puppet and model making, storytelling) and modem mass media 
technology (film, sound recording, computers), and in the interaction it permits between the realms of avant garde art and popular culture. 
Experiment and innovation take place across the whole range of animated films. 
[LOC Britain] has a long tradition of animation.... 
....This Channel seems set to continue its interest into the '90s. Animation archives have been established in museums such as [ORG MOMA], [LOC New York] and exhibitions of examples of drawings and artwork by animators have been held in a number of art galleries and sold to collectors and museums. 
In short, the artistic achievements of animation are increasingly being recognized and celebrated.

I also consulted the museum library’s vertical files and found the following information in a pamphlet announcing an exhibition of [PER McCoy] 's work: 
“January 6 – February 17, 1980

The [ORG Pennsylvania State University] 
University [LOC Park], [LOC Pennsylvania] 
I respond with excitement to those elemental forces and natural features that dominate my environment. 
The sea, the sky, the mountains – all the manifestations of nature’s fashioning have exerted a great influence on my work. 
For a time the ocean and the undersea dominated my thought and feeling, and from time to time, though I am long removed from the great waters, their influence evidences itself in my paintings. 
Later the canyons, coulees, and mountains of the West became strong forces in shaping my thought, and later still, the cliffs, caves, caverns, and rocky outcroppings of the eastern [LOC United States] commenced to exert a strong influence. 
A synthesis of these experiences is evident in my present work… 
[PER Wirth McCoy]” 
Also included in the pamphlet is the following biographical information: 
“Wirth V. McCoy, professor emeritus of art at the [ORG Pennsylvania State University], was born in [LOC Duluth], [LOC Minnesota]. 
He was educated at the universities of [LOC Minnesota] and [LOC Iowa], the [ORG California School of Fine Arts], and [ORG L’Academie de la Grande Chaumiere] in [LOC Paris]. 
Before coming to [ORG Penn State] in 1964, Professor McCoy taught at [ORG Oregon State University] and [ORG Washington State University], where he was professor of art, resident artist, and director of the [ORG Washington State Spokane Art Center]. 
At [ORG Penn State] he served for seven years as head of the [ORG Department of Art]. 
During the past several years, until his recent retirement, he taught painting full time to both undergraduate and graduate students. 
Along with his interest in teaching and his serious preoccupation with painting, Wirth McCoy has maintained a concern for community involvement in art. 
He has served on art boards in [LOC Pennsylvania] and [LOC Washington] and was chairman of the art committee for the first [ORG Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts]. 
He is well known as a lecturer and juror of exhibitions. 
As a painter he has an extensive exhibition record, and his work is included in collections throughout the [LOC United States.”] 
The pamphlet lists 20 paintings that appeared in the exhibition, and each is listed as being part of the artist’s private collection. 
In addition, the museum 's file for McCoy contained a clipping from a catalogue entitled, [MISC 19 ARTISTS 1970: AN EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS, SCULPTURE, PRINTS, PHOTOGRAPHY AND CERAMICS BY THE FACULTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ART, PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, MARCH 28-MAY 17, 1970] ([LOC Harrisburg]: [ORG William Penn Memorial Museum], 1970). 
The clipping restates much of the biographical information provided above, and includes the following paragraph: 
“McCoy’s paintings have been shown in one-man exhibitions in the West and [LOC Midwest]. 
In the East his work has been included in two traveling exhibitions: “Western Painters” and “Painters of the Northwest.” 
Unfortunately, after consulting numerous sources, I was unable to discover where McCoy 's artwork is located.

I have incuded information from THE [MISC GROVE DICTIONARY OF ART ONLINE] (http://www.groveart.com [ January 2004 access requires account]: 
" Mozarabic [ Sp. mozárabe]. 
Term traditionally used to describe the art of Christians living in the areas of the Iberian peninsula ruled by Muslims in the 10th and 11th centuries. 
The Castilian word derives from the Arabic musta ? rib (‘Arabized’) and is to be contrasted with Mudéjar, the term used to describe the art of Islamic inspiration produced for non-Muslim patrons in the areas of the Iberian peninsula reconquered by Christians between 1085 and the 16th century. 
Very few surviving works of art fit this strict definition of Mozarabic art, and it is difficult to characterize them. 
The only substantial building is the ruined three-aisled basilica at Mesas de Villaverde (Málaga; often identified as ‘Bobastro’), which preserves its rock-cut foundations and walls (see [LOC Spain], §II, 2). 
The two illuminated manuscripts surviving from this period are quite different in style. 
The Biblia Hispalense ([LOC Madrid], Bib. 
13–1), copied c. 
900 at or near Seville by or for [PER Bishop Servandus] and completed in 988 when figures of three prophets were added, shows some naturalism in the presentation of the symbols of the Evangelists. 
Ildefonsus’s Treatise on the Virginity of [PER Mary] ([LOC Florence], Bib. 
[LOC Medicea-Laurenziana], [LOC MS.] Ashb. 
17), copied in [LOC Toledo] by the archpriest Salomon in 1067, has distinctly Islamic-style foliage although the iconography is Hispanic.

The following background on Japonisme (also spelled Japanism], Japonism) is from [MISC THE GROVE DICTIONARY OF ART ONLINE]: http://www.groveart.com/tdaonline/articles: [ Accessed May 2004]: 
" Japonisme. 
French term used to describe a range of European borrowings from Japanese art. 
It was coined in 1872 by the French critic, collector and printmaker [PER Philippe Burty] 'to designate a new field of study-artistic, historic and ethnographic', encompassing decorative objects with Japanese designs (similar to 18th-century Chinoiserie), paintings of scenes set in [LOC Japan], and Western paintings, prints and decorative arts influenced by Japanese aesthetics. 
" Scholars in the 20th century have distinguished japonaiserie, the depiction of Japanese subjects or objects in a Western style, from Japonisme, the more profound influence of Japanese aesthetics on Western art. 
" 1. 
Origins and diffusion. 
There has been wide debate over who was the first artist in the West to discover Japanese art and over the date of this discovery. 
... 
" 2. 
Painting and graphic arts. 
From the early 1860s Japonisme could be found in nearly all media across a variety of stylistic movements. 
In painting and the graphic arts it influenced the asymmetrical compositions of [PER Degas] and [PER Henri Toulouse-Lautrec], the book illustrations of [PER Walter Crane] and the wood-engravings of [PER Winslow Homer]. 
... 
" 3. 
Decorative arts. 
Japonisme in the decorative arts at first consisted primarily of imitations of Japanese models, with stylistic features paralleling Japonisme in painting; features such as asymmetrical compositions, pure bright colours combined in complementary colour schemes, and bold flat patterns and motifs. 
Many of these were copied directly from Japanese craftsmen 's manuals and dyers' stencils. 
... 
" 4. 
Conclusion. 
Western artists sought inspiration in Japanese art for a variety of reasons. 
In the applied arts Japonisme arose froma widespread study of historic decoration, stemming from a desire to improve the quality of design in manufactured goods.

The following information on American art of the 1920s is from [PER Diane Tepfer] 's " [MISC Twentieth-Century Realism: The American Scene], " in [MISC AMERICAN ART ANALOG], v.3 ([LOC New York]: [ORG Chelsea House Publisher], 1986): 
" At the close of 1934, Time magazine 's cover article (December 24) reported: 
A few years ago many a good [LOC U.S.] artist was content to borrow from [LOC France], turn out tricky intellectual canvases which usually irritated or mystified the public. 
Today most top-notch [LOC U.S.] artists get their inspiration from their native land, find beauty and interest in subjects like [LOC Kansas] farmers, [LOC Iowa] fields, and [LOC Manhattan] burlesques.... 
Although Sheeler and many of the other artists mentioned above were known in the 1920s and 1930s as the immaculates, the style has also been labeled cubist realism, and is now called precisionism. 
Its practitioners worked independently, without a manifesto or program. 
Precisionism attracted the intelligentsia....

Additional information on art during the 1920s is from [PER Wayne Craven] 's book [MISC AMERICAN ART: HISTORY AND CULTURE] ([LOC Boston]: [ORG McGraw-Hill], 1994): 
" PAINTING: THE MODERN MODE, 1900-1940 
The period 1900 to 1940 was a time of radical change. 
It was an era when socialism, communism, and anarchism challenged capitalism and the values of the upper middleclass. 
It was the era of world war, prohibition, prosperity, and the Great Depression.... 
THE PARISIAN INFLUENCE 
Even more than writers, painters and sculptors were influenced by the revolutionary spirit. 
For the young American artist, [LOC Paris] was the place to be in the early years of the twentieth century.... 
Three main thrusts came from Paris: Fauvism, Cubism, and, slightly later, Dadaism-Surrealism. 
Even Futurism, which originated in [LOC Italy], became known to Americans primarily in [LOC Paris]. 

===
[LOC Germany] gave birth to a new movement called Expressionism, but its harsh use of color and image repelled many Americans....

The following entry is an excerpt from a larger article on censorship in [MISC GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 17 April 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]:[ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to GROVE ART: 
" Censorship. 
Control of expression that is regarded as outside of and a threat to the religious, political and social orthodoxy of the time. 
Throughout history, when governments and other powerful institutions of society have been fearful of the power of art to challenge the established order, they have sought to suppress the works of literature and art that appear decadent, disruptive, indecent or immoral. 
Manifestations of the control of artistic expression are historically and culturally specific. 
Nevertheless, close consideration reveals recurring themes and issues. 
Religious orthodoxies have often provided the parameters of what is or is not acceptable to be seen by an audience. 
The censorship of religious art, including the banning, destruction or alteration of works, is roughly equated with the term Iconoclasm, for example the battle waged by the Jews against any type of idolatry until the end of the 2nd century ad, and the iconoclastic controversies of the Byzantine empire (ad 726-843). 
Although the motivation of iconoclasm is complex, it almost always has a significant political dimension... 
In 1536 the French theologian and reformer Calvin gave impetus to the Puritan ethic against art that already existed in the writings of [PER St. Augustine], [PER Girolamo Savonarola] and other European religious reformers. 
As detailed in his Christianae religionis institutio (Basle, 1536), [PER Calvin] preached against two kinds of false art: art that is against Christ (the use of images in the Church) and art for art 's sake (art that exists only for enjoyment; see also Calvinism)... 
" 
[ Editor: copyrighted text above truncated] 
Your question touches on the broader subject of " Colonial art. 
" Some of the earliest American artists working under the influence of Puritanism were called limners. 
The following entry on " [MISC Limners] " is from [MISC DICTIONARY OF ART] by [PER Matthew Baigell] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Harper & Row], 1979): 
" Limner: 
The term limner comes from the verb to limn, derived from an old French word meaning to illuminate books with ornamental letters and borders. 
In American art, the term denotes the anonymous, Colonial artisan-painters who created our earliest portraits, landscapes, and still lifes. 
Their naive style is characterized by the rendering of objects as two-dimensional pattern. 
It is also an appellation given to early artists who are known to us only through the people whose portraits they painted. 
Among the best-known are the [PER Mason Limner], the [PER Pollard Limner], and the [PER Stuyvesant Limner]. 
These artists were active in both New [LOC England] and [LOC New York] between 1660 and 1730. 
One of the finest and most affecting examples of their work is a portrait of the child [PER Alice Mason] (1670, [ORG Adams National Historic Site], [LOC Quincy], [LOC Mass.] 
). 
The absence of modelling in the face and figure, the undifferentiated light and undeveloped spatial sense are more than compensated for by the charming manner in which costume and ornament are carefully detailed... 
" 
[ Editor: copyrighted text above truncated] 
Additional information about the relationship between Puritanism and the [PER Limner] portraits is from [PER Wayne Craven] 's book [MISC AMERICAN ART: HISTORY AND CULTURE] ([LOC New York]: [ORG H. N. Abrams], 1994): 
"...Who were the people who appeared in these portraits ? 
For the most part, in New [LOC England], they came from the urban merchant class. 
As it prospered, it created a kind of mercantile aristocracy at the tip of the social pyramid. 
These people were determined to succeed in the world, and they possessed a powerful strain of materialism--something that seems to have become part of the American character virtually with the founding of the country. 
They listened to their ministers in the meetinghouse on the sabbath, but then devoted the rest of the week to profits in the counting houses. 
Neither they nor their ministers saw anything wrong with that. 
In fact [PER John Calvin], the religious reformer they followed, had written in his Institutes of [ORG Christian Religion] (1536), that it was a [MISC Christian] duty to fulfill one 's secular calling to the best of one 's abilities. 
Obedience in this would please God, and would be rewarded with prosperity. 
This so-called " Puritan work ethic " was broader than Puritanism, for it applied to the middle-class generally. 
It proclaimed worldly effort to be a way of praising [PER God]. 
It was tailormade for the ambitious middleclass because it gave spiritual sanction to people 's aggressive will to prosper. 
According to Marxist interpretation--which looks at society from a workingclass rather than an upper middleclass point of view--this philosophy of life was a misguided bourgeois fallacy. 
But it was a value-system that was subscribed to by people like the Freakes, whose portraits will soon be considered. 
The earliest American paintings were exclusively portraits. 
As is the case with all art, their style expresses something of the society and culture from which they sprang--in this case, a middleclass, Protestant background. 
In the seventeenth century, the middleclass had an art of its own that was distinct from that patronized by royal courts and aristocratic circles. 
The type of portrait that Sir [PER Peter Lely] (1616-80), the court painter, created of [PER King Charles II] simply would not have done for a man of the merchant class. 
Thus, two strains of art evolved in England-one princely, the other middleclass. 
The purpose of the latter was not only to preserve a likeness in the portrait, but also to express deep-rooted secular and even religious values. 
The images of the men, women, and children of the so-called " Puritan century " were not always manifestations of Puritan gloom. 
Much more often they were icons that praised worldly prosperity and such secular virtues as industry and moderation. 
Contrary to popular belief, the Puritans did not have any prejudice against art, except for the religious imagery of Catholicism. 
Portraiture was the main form of painting in [LOC England], and such art was acceptable to New Englanders once they had established their settlements, obtained sufficient wealth to support such an art, and finally had someone in their mist who could produce it. 
All of this fell into place around 1665 to 1675...

After moving from [LOC New York City] to [LOC Puerto Rico] at age two, he spent his early years with his fisherman cousin who often told him the perils of the sea. 
Inspired by these tales, [PER Lebron] and his cousin would illustrate these stories on old paper bags. 
From boats to battlefields, they discovered the magic of art. 
He returned to [LOC New York] in the 1930s and it didn't take long for [PER Lebron] 's teachers to discover his abilities. 
He won admission to [LOC New York] 's prestigious high school for art and music, The Art Student 's [LOC League]. 
After serving in the [ORG United States Air Force], he attended art college and then launched his career as an artist.

[MISC SURVEY OF AMERICAN PAINTING] 
http://lieven.studentenweb.org/americanpainting.html 
I am not sure what you mean by " design artist, " but I assume you are referring to graphic designers. 
The different categories of art and artists are not limited to graphic design and fine. 
Others include applied and decorative art. 
These are further divided by medium (paint, wood, glass, etc. 
). 
However, the divisions between the general types of art are becoming less clear as artists create works that combine elements of different types. 
I found the following definitions of the categories in [MISC THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF ART] edited by [PER Ian Childers] and [PER Harold Osborne] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Oxford University Press], 1997): 
page 26: 
" applied art. 
Term describing the design or decoration of functional objects so as to make them aesthetically pleasing. 
It is used in distinction to fine art, although there is often no clear dividing line between the two. 
" 
page 243: 
" graphic art. 
Term current with several different meanings in the literature of the visual arts. 
In the context of the fine arts, it most usually refers to those arts that rely essentially on line or tone rather than colour - i.e. drawing and the various forms of engraving. 
Some writers, however, exclude drawing from this definition, so that the term 'graphic art' is used to cover the various processes by which prints are created. 
In another sense, the term - sometimes shortened to 'graphics' - is used to cover the entire field of commercial printing, including text as well as illustrations. 
" 
page 153: 
" decorative arts. 
Term embracing applied art and also including objects that are made purely for decoration. 
" 
page 200: 
" fine arts. 
Term applied to the 'higher' non-utilitarian arts, as opposed to applied or decorative arts. 
In its most common usage the term is taken to cover painting, sculpture, and architecture (even though architecture is obviously a 'useful' art), but it is often extended to cover poetry and music too. 
" 
To understand what different types of artists do, you may want to look at THE OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK (http://www.bls.gov/oco/ [ January 2004]), the Web version of a book published by the government. 
It describes many professions, their outlook, and average salaries. 
The Handbook has entries for both visual artists and designers. 
Your topic is interesting but extremely broad. 
Entire books have been written on the subject of modern and post-modern sculpture. 
Regrettably, this... reference service cannot provide the essay length answer you need due to our high volume of questions. 
However, let me get you started on your research by suggesting general resources that will help you define your subject: 
First, let 's start with some definitions. 
The following definitions for these terms is from ArtLex (http://www.artlex.com [ August 2003]), an online dictionary of art: 
" Modernism or modernism - An art movement characterized by the deliberate departure from tradition and the use of innovative forms of expression that distinguish many styles in the arts and literature of the late nineteenth and the twentieth century. 
Modernism refers to this period 's interest in new types of paints and other materials, in expressing feelings and ideas, in creating abstractions and fantasies, rather than representing what is real. 
This kind of art requires its audience to observe carefully in order to get some facts about the artist, his intentions, and his environment, before forming judgments about the work. 
[PER Paul Cézanne] (French, 1839-1906) is often called the 'Father of Modernism.' 
" postmodern or postmodernism - Art, architecture, or literature that reacts against earlier modernist principles, as by reintroducing traditional or classical elements of style or by carrying modernist styles or practices to extremes. 
" 
And the following articles are from [ORG GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 9 April 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library: According to GROVE ART: 
" Modernism. 
Term applied to the invention and the effective pursuit of artistic strategies that seek not just close but essential connections to the powerful forces of social Modernity. 
The responses of modernists to modernity range from triumphal celebration to agonized condemnation and differ in mode from direct picturing of the impacts of modernization to extreme renovations of purely artistic assumptions and practice.... 
Some early usages of the term 'm odernism' occur in the context of the recurrent battle between the new and the old.... 
Within this fast-changing context, certain moments in the history of the visual arts stand out as definitively modernist. 
The play of modernizing forces in [LOC Paris] in the 1850s and 1860s was manifest in Courbet 's critical realism, [PER Manet] 's induction of the aesthetics of popular spectacle into high art, and the poetics and art criticism of charles [PER Baudelaire]... . 
Towards the end of the 19th century the term 'm odernist' was adopted to identify Art Nouveau tendencies in many European countries. 
A related usage appeared in the claims of Secession artists in [LOC Germany] and elsewhere. 
In the years after 1900 [LOC Paris] was the centre of an explosion of artistic innovations, by Fauvist and Cubist artists, which inspired radical experimentation by Futurists in [LOC Italy], Suprematists and Constructivists in [LOC Russia], Dadaists in [LOC Germany] and many others. 
Subsequent tendencies, such as Surrealism, explored the social and psychological impacts of modernization even more deeply.... 
At the same time developments in modern art were fashioned into influential historical narratives in such exhibitions as [PER Manet] and the Post-Impressionists ([LOC London], 1910), opened by the critic roger Fry, and new markets for modernist art were created by the Armory show ([LOC New York], 1913) and others..... 
As a name for the mainstream tendency in 20th-century abstract art 'm odernism' came into widespread usage only in the 1960s. 
It was applied to the Abstract Expressionists and to contemporary hard-edge painting, colour field painting and abstract sculpture, most influentially by the American critic [PER Clement Greenberg].... 
What were the practices of modernist artists ? 
A typical strategy was to provoke the shock of the new, to reveal the present as replete with blindingly self-evident value and, at the same instant, to consign the recent past to anachronism. 
Another was to imagine the future as within reach, and still another was to reclaim the distant and even ancient past as a generalized precedent, a repository of essential values that transcended the style-bound historicisms of the 19th century.... 
In the late 20th century, however, the limitations of modernism, its wasteful exclusions, became increasingly evident.... 
While modernism no longer inspires artists, its heroic history and its accumulation of masterworks have became standard fare within educated taste as it consumes the visual arts with ever-increasing enthusiasm.... 
Post-modern artists and theorists (see Post-modernism) tend to reject modernism as a historical narrative binding on current practice, while at the same time rehearsing some of its strategies and quoting instances of early modernist art as allusions within their circulating of imagery from, potentially, anywhere and any time... 
"Post-modernism. 
Term used to characterize developments in architecture and the arts in the 1960s and after, when there was a clear challenge to the dominance of modernism; the term was applied predominantly from the 1970s to architecture and somewhat later to the decorative and visual arts.... 
If the attachment of the label itself is ignored, however, the developments may be perceived as continuous with the anti-modernism of the 1960s, which readily related to the growing pluralism in art and architecture that came to be associated with Post-modernism from the early 1980s. 
2. 
Other arts. 
[PER Oldenburg] 's dictum of 1961 characterized the ambience in which Pop art returned to the figure, historical allusion and a dialogue with mass culture. 
It provided models for a break away from modernist principles in architecture as well as art, to which, curiously, the label 'Post-modern' was not attached until somewhat later.... 
The movement was centred around artist-run galleries in [LOC Manhattan] and took much from feminism, performance art, Post-structuralism and deconstruction, calling 'm eaning' itself into question.... 
As in architecture, the growing range of motivations tended to outgrow the Post-modern label, except 
insofar as all polemic arguments united to gainsay the hypocrisies of the modernist position. 
" 
[ Editor truncated copyrighted text above] 
There is also a great deal of information specific to modern and post-modern sculpture in the book [MISC AMERICAN ART: HISTORY AND CULTURE] by [PER Wayne Craven] ([LOC Boston]: [ORG McGraw-Hill], 1994). 
There is too much information to provide here on the different characteristics and types of sculpture, but you can track this title through your local public or university library. 
If you can't find it, ask a librarian to order the book through inter-library loan. 
I 've provided some excerpts from the book below: 
(page 483) "...NATURE AND CLASSICISM ABSTRACTED: At the turn of the century, Americans were still remembering the great World 's Columbian Exposition at [LOC Chicago] in 1893-a veritable extravaganza of Beaux-Arts architecture and sculpture. 
By 1900, [PER John Quincy Adams Ward], [PER Augustus Saint-Gaudens], and [PER Daniel Chester French] were still active, representing the academic tradition, which seemed firmly entrenched with such institutions as the [ORG National Sculpture Society] and the [ORG National Academy of Design]. 
Almost all other sculptors worked in a similar academic, Beaux-Arts-inspired manner, which did not begin to suggest the diversity and controversy-even what some would call anarchy and insanity-that beset American sculpture in the four decades preceding World War 11. 
That unity, however, was soon split asunder into a diversity of artistic expression. 
The major movements included: The continuation of the Beaux-Arts style; a new academic tradition led by [PER Paul Manship]; a brief affiliation with the romantic style of [PER Auguste Rodin]: a realist counterpart to the art of The Eight (see p. 
423); Art Deco (see p. 
415); experimentation with form as inspired by Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada, and other " isms " from European modern art (see chapter 30); direct carving; the early wire constructions of [PER Alexander Calder]; the work of sculptors whose art defies categorization: [PER Gaston Lachaise] and [PER Hugo Robus], for example; and African American sculpture... 
" 
and (page 586) "...REDEFINING SCULPTURE: Sculpture after WWII presents one of the most complex phenomena in the history of American art. 
The traditional techniques and forms of three-dimensional art are questioned, and the basic conception of the medium is reformulated. 
Its vitality is suggested by the sheer number of movements: Cubism, Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism, Constructivism, Assemblage (found object), Pop Art, Minimalism, Site/Environments, Process Art, Concept Art and a revival of realism. 
Significantly different techniques are employed, and media range from traditional bronze to neon lights, from discarded toys to industrial products, from gold wire to vinal and plastic. 
The scale runs the gamut from a small box to landscape manipulations involving vast spaces. 
The studio and the gallery are inadequate to accommodate the scale and concepts, so sculpture moves outdoors to dominate the urban plaza, or to harmonize in monumentality with the desert, mountain range or lake. 
There was a revolution in form after the war. 
For centuries, sculpture had been conceived in terms of mass. 
Now, for several artists, sculpture changed from an art concerned with mass and volume to one involved mainly with light and space, with little or no need for mass. 
If there was revolution however, there was also reaction. 
As this period opened, there were numerous sculptors working in the styles, techniques and media from earlier in the century...

Term used to characterize developments in architecture and the arts in the 1960s and after, when there was a clear challenge to the dominance of modernism; the term was applied predominantly from the 1970s to architecture and somewhat later to the decorative and visual arts... 
2. 
Other arts. 
[PER Oldenburg] 's dictum of 1961 characterized the ambience in which Pop art returned to the figure, historical allusion and a dialogue with mass culture. 
It provided models for a break away from modernist principles in architecture as well as art, to which, curiously, the label 'Post-modern' was not attached until somewhat later....

" [PER Cassatt, Mary] (1844-1926) 
[PER Mary Cassatt], the only American in the French impressionist movement, was born in the [LOC Pittsburgh] suburb of [LOC Allegheny City], where her father served as mayor before moving his family into [LOC Pittsburgh], [LOC Pennsylvania]. 
The businessman next took his family to [LOC Philadelphia], [LOC Pennsylvania], and scarcely two years later, in 1851, to [LOC Europe], where they remained for four years.... 
Her first recognition came in 1868 when the [ORG Paris Salon], [LOC France], accepted her painting 'La Mandoline' and was reinforced in 1870, when the [LOC Paris Salon] accepted a painting she had just done on an Italian trip, 'Contadina di Fabello.'... 
She then moved on to [LOC Seville]. 
[LOC Spain], where she had a studio at the Casa de Pilatos.... 
Both 'Torero and Young Girl'and 'On the Balcony during the Carnival, ' ([ORG Philadelphia Museum of Art]), [LOC Pennsylvania], were shown at the annual exhibition of the [ORG National Academy of Design] in [LOC New York City] in 1874. 
[PER Edgar Degas] had admired [PER Cassatt] 's portrait, 'Ida, ' in the [ORG Paris Salon] of 1874 and invited her to exhibit with his group of independent artists known as the impressionists.... 
In the 1879 impressionist exhibition (the fourth), [PER Cassatt] was represented by eleven paintings which were praised in the press for their effects of light and shade.... 
For the next exhibition of 1881 she showed her recent plein-air paintings and again experienced success, this time selling almost all her entries; the critic [PER Elie de Mont] asserted that [PER Cassatt] and [PER Berthe Morisot] were the only interesting artists exhibiting.... 
Of her seven paintings in the final eighth impressionist show of 1886, one was 'Young Girl at the Window' (1883, Corcoran Gallery of Art] 
, [LOC Washington], [LOC D.C.]
) in which [PER Susan,] a cousin of [PER Cassatt] 's housekeeper, sits on the balcony of [PER Cassatt] 's [LOC Paris] apartment.... 
In the 1890s the figures in her paintings became a little more solid and linear, perhaps partly influenced by her graphic art; for example, two strongly-outlined figures are at the forefront of 'Women Picking Fruit' (1891, [ORG Carnegie Institute Museum of Art]), and three solid figures constitute The Boating Party' (1893, [ORG National Gallery of Art], [LOC Washington], [LOC D.C]. 
).... 
The French government recognized [PER Cassatt] 's achievements in 1904 by making her a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.... 
Operations for cataracts in her eyes were not successful, and finally in 1915 she gave up painting. 
She died on June 14, 1926 at her chateau in Mesnil-Beaufresne. 
.... 
Her own paintings, of which more than 600 have been cataloged, can be found today in the major museums of the world.

The following definition for the term Impressionism is from [MISC ArtLex] (http://www.artlex.com [ August 2003]), an online dictionary of art terms: 
" impressionism - An art movement and style of painting that started in [LOC France] during the 1860s. 
Impressionist artists tried to paint candid glimpses of their subjects showing the effects of sunlight on things at different times of day. 
The leaders of this movement were: [PER Camille Pissarro] (French, 1830-1903), [PER Edgar Degas] (French, 1834-1917), [PER Claude Monet] (French, 1840-1926), and [PER Pierre Renoir] (French, 1841-1919). 
Some of the early work of [PER Paul Cézanne] (French, 1839-1906) fits into this style, though his later work so transcends it that it belongs to another movement known as Post-impressionism. 
" 
A more in-depth discussion of this art movement is from [MISC GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 13 April 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 

====
" impressionism. 
Term generally applied to a movement in art in [LOC France] in the late 19th century. 
The primary use of the term Impressionist is for a group of French painters who worked between around 1860 and 1900, especially to describe their works of the later 1860s to mid-1880s. 
These artists include [PER Frédéric Bazille], [PER Paul Cézanne], [PER Edgar Degas], [PER Edouard Manet], [PER Claude Monet], [PER Berthe Morisot], [PER Camille Pissarro], [PER Auguste Renoir] and [PER Alfred Sisley], as well as [PER Mary Cassatt], [PER Gustave Caillebotte] (who was also an important early collector), [PER Eva Gonzalès], [PER Armand Guillaumin] and [PER Stanislas Lépine].... 
The term was first used to characterize the group in response to the first exhibition of independent artists in 1874. 
[PER Louis Leroy] and other hostile critics seized on the title of a painting by [PER Monet], Impression, Sunrise (1873; [LOC Paris], [ORG Mus]. 
Marmottan; see fig. 
1), as exemplifying the radically unfinished character of the works. 
The word impression to describe the immediate effect of a perception was in use at the time by writers on both psychology and art. 
[PER Jules-Antoine Castagnary] 's review (1874) demonstrates that it was not always used in a negative way: 'They are Impressionists in the sense that they render not the landscape but the sensation produced by the landscape. 
The name stuck, despite its lack of precision, and came to be used by the artists themselves. 
Typical Impressionist paintings are landscapes or scenes of modern life, especially of bourgeois recreation.... 
1. 
Sources and emergence of the style. 
Impressionism grew out of traditions of landscape painting and Realism in [LOC France]. 
The immediate predecessors of the Impressionists were [PER Gustave Courbet] and the Barbizon painters. 
The young artists accepted [PER Courbet] 's notion that the artist 's own time and experience were the appropriate subject-matter for art.... 
The Barbizon artists provided the Impressionists with a model of observed, specific, non-historical landscape with attention to times of day and seasons, often painted out of doors. 
Many of the Impressionists had direct contact with members of the older generation, whom they sometimes encountered in the 1860s painting in the forest of [LOC Fontainebleau].... 
5. 
The influence of impressionism. 
Because impressionism combined new approaches to formal issues while remaining a naturalist art, it affected a variety of movements in the later 19th century. 
Although their works were controversial, the Impressionists were acknowledged as a force in the art of their time, and they contributed to an opening up of the art world. 
The term 'Impressionist' was used widely and imprecisely as a generic word for vanguard artists or to describe some artists who exhibited in the [ORG Salon].... 
Later artists found impressionism liberating in its insistence on the artist 's sensibility rather than on academic rules as the determining factor in creating a picture. 
It provided an example for artists who wished to use colour and brushwork, expressively and who wished to find new ways of composing. 
Its limitation for later artists seemed to be its reliance on nature for inspiration...

Although it influenced painting and sculpture, its chief manifestations were in architecture and the decorative and graphic arts, the aspects on which this survey concentrates. 
It is characterized by sinuous, asymmetrical lines based on organic forms; in a broader sense it encompasses the geometrical and more abstract patterns and rhythms that were evolved as part of the general reaction to 19th-century historicism. 
There are wide variations in the style according to where it appeared and the materials that were employed.

The following definition of " Modernism " was excerpted from a longer article on the topic in the [MISC DICTIONARY OF ART] ([LOC London]: [ORG Macmillan], 1996): 
" Modernism. 
Term applied to the invention and the effective pursuit of artistic strategies that seek not just close but essential connections to the powerful forces of social MODERNITY. 
The responses of modernists to modernity range from triumphal celebration to agonized condemnation and differ in mode from direct picturing of the impacts of modernization to extreme renovations of purely artistic assumptions and practice. 
Such strategies - pursued by artists working individually or, often, in groups, as well as by critics, historians and theorists - occur in all of the am, although in distinctive forms and across varying historical trajectories. 
They have been strongest in painting, design and the MODERN MOVEMENT in architecture, highly significant in literature and in music, but quite muted in the crafts. 
They have echoes in aspects of commercial and popular culture. 
Despite being intermittent in their occurrence and unsystematic in nature, these strategies have been most effective in [LOC Europe] and its colonies from the mid-19th century and in the [LOC USA] from the early 20th, moving from the margins to the centre of visual cultures, from reactive radicality to institutionalized normality. 
Some early usages of the term 'm odernism' occur in the context of the recurrent battle between the new and the old. 
In 1737 [PER Jonathan Swift] complained to [PER Alexander Pope] about 'the corruption of English by those Scribblers, who send us over their trash in Prose and Verse, with abominable curtailings and quaint Modernisms (Published Works, 1757, ix: 218b). 
Yet such disputes were usually local ones, occurring within broader frameworks of cultural continuity, except at periods of epochal change.During the 19th century in [LOC Europe], however, modernizing forces became hegemonic, and by the mid-20th century modernity had become the norm in many parts of the world, its effects being felt everywhere. 
Within this fast-changing context, certain moments inthe history of the visual arts stand out as definitively modernist. 
The play of modernizing forces in [LOC Paris] in the 1850s and 1860s was manifest in [PER Courbet] 's critical realism, [PER Manet] 's induction of the aesthetics of popular spectacle into high aM and the poetics and art criticism of [PER CHARLES BAUDELAIRE]. 
By modernite, [PER Baudelaire] wrote in 1863 'I mean the ephemeral the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable'. 
These artists and writers recognized that to make significant, potentially timeless art, it was necessary to begin from the transitory, ever-changing present. 
This reversed the historical teachings of the academies. 
Towards the end of the 19th century the term modernist' was adopted to identify ART NOUVEAU tendencies in many European countries. 
A related usage appeared in the claims of SECESSION artists in [LOC Germany] and elsewhere....

I 've provided an excerpt from this article below: 
" Early Christian and Byzantine art. 
The art produced by the peoples of the Roman Empire from the early 4th century AD to c. 
600—as well as specifically Christian art from c. 
250—and that produced in the eastern half of the Empire, centred around [LOC Constantinople] ([LOC Byzantium]) to 1453.... 
Early Christian and Byzantine art , §I, 1 (i): Chronological survey 
(a) Early Christian, c. 
250–c. 
843. 
In the 3rd century, Christianity had spread to many cities of the Roman Empire but was from time to time subject to persecution, hence the dominant pattern of house-church and (for funerary purposes) catacombs, together with prevalent themes of monumental painting and mosaic... 
By the 390s both Christianity and [LOC Constantinople] had achieved greater status under Theodosios I, who was responsible for major building work in [LOC Constantinople] and for additions in [LOC Palestine].... 
The 6th century has often been called the age of Justinian in view of the large number of his buildings surviving from the period (and a contemporary descriptive work by [PER Prokopios], Buildings, purporting to list them), his attempts at reconquering [LOC North Africa] (533–4), [LOC Italy] (535–55) and [LOC Spain] (554), and his efforts in systematizing the law and its teaching... 
The last honorific column to be erected in the Forum Romanum, [LOC Rome], was that by Phokas (reg 602–10).... 
...The iconoclast policy instituted by [PER Leo] and [PER Constantine V Kopronymos] (reg 741–75) opposing the use of images in worship is of considerable interest for the relationship between religion and art in Byzantine society.... 
of iconoclast resurgence. 
(b) Middle Byzantine, c. 
843–1204. 
Although a revival in the cultural life of the empire has been detected c. 
790, with more manuscripts being copied, in particular uncial manuscripts into minuscule, a political recovery that might have supported this was much delayed.... 
The 11th century has been well characterized as a period of peace and prosperity with an expanding economy, increased urbanization and much surplus wealth.... 
During the 12th century stable rule by the Komnenoi also encouraged the settlement of Westerners in [LOC Constantinople] from [LOC Pisa], [LOC Genoa] and [LOC Venice], each of these cities having received favourable trading arrangements as the price of support in 1082 against the Normans.... 
(c) Late Byzantine, 1204–1453. 
After the fall of [LOC Constantinople], successor states at Nicaea, Trebizond and Arta competed to maintain Byzantine institutions and patronage. 
Increasingly, however, the market for Byzantine art came from outside the areas of Byzantine control, such as [LOC Serbia] and [LOC Bulgaria...]. 
The fragmentation of Byzantine power also highlighted the importance of cities in this period; [LOC Thessaloniki] had a brief life (1342–9) as a commune and Mystras outlived (until 1461) [LOC Constantinople], which fell to the Ottoman Turks on 29 May 1453...

Although you are likely to find useful information about [PER Andy Warhol] 's life and images of his artwork on the Web, the Internet is not always the best place to find authoritative information on such a specific topic as you have described.

I have included for you an excerpt from a longer article on Pop Art in the [MISC GLOSSARY OF ART, ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN SINCE 1945] by [PER John A. Walker] ([LOC Boston], [LOC MA]: [ORG G.K. Hall], 1992): 
" Pop Art (Also Commodity Art, Commonism, Consumer Style, Consumerist Realism, Factualist Art, Gag Art, Industrial Art, New Sign Painting, New Super Realism, 0 K Art, Reactionary Realism) 
...Pop Art emerged in the mid and late 1950s in [LOC Britain] - the work of [PER Peter Blake], [PER Richard Hamilton] and [PER Eduardo Paolozzi] - and it flourished in the 1960s in both [LOC Europe] and the [LOC United States]. 
British Pop Artists of the 1960s included [PER Clive Barker], [PER Derek Boshier], [PER Pauline Boty], [PER Patrick Caulfield], [PER David Hockney], [PER Allen Jones], [PER Peter Phillips] and [PER Joe Tilson]. 
The Americans included [PER Jim Dine], [PER Jann Haworth] (who worked in [LOC Britain]), [PER Robert Indiana], [PER Roy Lichtenstein], [PER Claes Oldenburg], [PER Mel Ramos], [PER Larry Rivers], [PER James Rosenquist], [PER Andy Warhol] and [PER Tom Wesselmann]. 
[PER R. B. Kitaj] - American but resident in [LOC London] - was also associated with the movement though he has refused the label 'Pop Artist'. 
Some histories of Pop also encompass the work of the European nouveaux realistes. 
The 1950s neo-dada work of [PER Jasper Johns] and [PER Robert Rauschenberg] was a major influence on the development of Pop An which was part of a widespread reaction against the dominant, gestural abstract painting styles of the 1950s. 
Pop was 'cool', analytical, detached in its manner. 
Not only did it draw its subject matter from the mass media and the affluent, consumer society, it also simulated the mechanistic, graphic styles and techniques of the mass media, e.g. 
[PER Lichtenstein] 's paintings based on comic-strip images imitated the ben day dots and hard-edge lines of the source material. 
Transformations of sources did occur in Pop Art - as material was transposed from 'low' to 'high' culture - but the extent to which a critical or moral comment was involved proved controversial. 
[PER Warhol] (1928-87) - who began as a commercial illustrator - was the quintessential Pop Artist. 
He became a media celebrity and a successful, wealthy businessman, head of an enterprise marketing products in a dozen different media. 
His art spanned the division between fine art and mass culture. 
Pop Art did, in fact, reach a far wider audience than previous avant garde movements and it fed back into the mass media themselves. 
[PER Peter Blake] too, through his record cover commissions for rock groups like the Beatles, managed to reach mass audiences.

This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
"Aboriginal [LOC Australia]. 
Culture of the original inhabitants of [LOC Australia] and their descendants. 
This survey covers the traditional art forms of the Australian Aborigines, such as rock art, sculpture in wood, clay and sand, body decoration and bark painting, both before and after European colonization took place at the end of the 18th century.... 
4. 
Role of the artist. 
Since art mediates between the present and the ancestral past, the artist plays an important role in Aboriginal society and may possess significant status in ceremonial and political affairs.... 
II. 
Traditional art forms. 
Aboriginal art is rich in the variety of its forms. 
The most durable art, and also that for which the earliest evidence exists, is rock art: examples of rock paintings and engravings, or petroglyphs (as they are also known), are found through the Australian continent.... 
7. 
Bark painting. 

====

Elaborately painted sheets of bark have gained appreciation in galleries, museums and private collections and for a while, in the 1960s and later, became almost synonymous with Aboriginal art. 
This type of bark painting, however, is relatively recent—the product of a gradually developing arts and crafts industry that began with European colonization—and the creation of such works is restricted to one main area, [PER Arnhem Land]... . 
(i) Techniques. 
The bark for painting comes from the local species of stringybark tree and can be obtained most easily when the sap is flowing during the wet season and the following few months.... 
(ii) Early evidence. 
Early records for the colonial period suggest that bark may have been used for painting in parts of southern [LOC Australia], for example [LOC Tasmania], the eastern part of [LOC South Australia] and [LOC Queensland], where there were suitable trees ([LOC Groger-Wurm]). 
The reports refer to paintings or drawings on the inside of bark huts or, more rarely, to the use of bark painting in ceremonial contexts.... 
(iii) Contemporary work. 
Bark paintings produced today reflect the range of stylistic characteristics of their region rather than, as formerly, the particular ceremonial context and set of subjects. 
Following European colonization, bark-painting imagery and styles became a product of the interaction between artists and purchasers.... 
Although [LOC Arnhem] Land remains the main area for the production of contemporary bark paintings..., works for sale are also produced by people living in the [LOC Kimberleys], where the figurative imagery is mainly of Wandjina ancestral beings.... 
Also, since the imagery painted on bark and other surfaces can only be produced by those with an inherited right to it, bark paintings are used as a means of presenting Aboriginal culture to outsiders.

And the following obituary appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES on January 10, 1960: 
" ARTIST IS KILLED IN CHICAGO BLAZE 
[PER Pierre Nuyttens], 83, Painted and Taught--Many Works Believed Destroyed [LOC Chicago], Jan. 9 (UPI) --Pierre Nuyttens, internationally known artist and art teacher, was found dead today in his burned-out near [LOC North Side] Apartment.

[PER Thomas Hill] was a prolific painter who produced many works entitled " [LOC Yosemite Valley]. 
" I checked the " Inventory of American Paintings Executed Before 1914 ", a large research database accessible on the Web (http://www.siris.si.edu [ February 2004]; select " Search Art Inventories "). 
The Inventory is a census of works in public and private collections and each work listed is described with the following information: artist, title of work, date of execution, medium, dimensions, subject, owner 's name and address (if known), reference citation, source of illustration. 
The Inventory lists over 80 works entitled " [LOC Yosemite Valley] " by [PER Thomas Hill]. 
I also checked standard signature sources and found that [PER Hill] signed his works " [PER T. Hill]. 
" 
A quick search of auction records informed me that several [LOC Yosemite Valley] works by or attributed to [PER Thomas Hill] have sold within the past ten years. 
Based on the information provided, it is impossible for me to determine which (if any) of the works that are listed in the Inventory or that sold at auction is the particular " [LOC Yosemite Valley] " to which you refer. 
My best suggestion would be for you to contact an art historian familiar with [PER Hill] 's work to authenticate the painting for you.

" Many may not know his name, but the serene, nostalgic charm of [PER Paul Detlefsens] paintings is familiar to just about everyone. 
It is no surprise since he was one of the most widely reprinted artists or our century. 
His art was lithographed into reproductions, calendars, jigsaw puzzles, playing cards, and even place mats for the table. 
[PER Paul Detlefsen], I am proud to say, moved to [LOC Hollywood], [LOC California] after completing high school and some training at the [ORG Chicago Art Institute]. 
There he worked a long and happy career in special effects. 
After 30 years he retired and began a new career as a calendar artist. 
In [PER Detlefsens] own words: And so it is that I set out to dream up beautiful places and try to make them come to life in my paintings... concentrating on realism, beauty and nostalgia. 
What I hope for most is that people will look at my paintings, smile and say: Id like to be there ! 
[PER Paul] and his wife, [PER Shelly,] moved to [LOC Del Mar] ([LOC CA]) in 1964 where he continued his painting till passing on in 1986. 
[PER Shelly] was also a very talented artist. 
His only daughter, [PER Karen Kozlow], has been an artist her entire life, creating in may different mediums, but settling on bright and whimsical ceramics for the last 20 years.

Perhaps the most important figure in [LOC America] 's photographic history, [PER Brady] was born of Irish immigrant parents in [LOC Warren County], [LOC N.Y.] As a youth he studied art with the painter [PER William Page], whom he accompanied to [LOC New York City] in the late 1830s. 
By 1843 he was a manufacturer of the leather cases used to protect the delicate daguerreotype images introduced into [LOC America] in 1840.... 
[PER Brady] 's historical sense (he referred to the camera as " the eye of history ") combined with the tragedy of the Civil War to make possible the vast body of photographs upon which his reputation rests.... 
It should be noted that while [PER Brady] was the most important photographer of this period, others surpassed him in ability. 
[PER Brady] declared that he spent over $100,000 to secure this visual record of the war; this outlay,... brought him to bankruptcy in 1873....

The following article on paperweights is from GROVE ART 
http://www.groveart.com/ (accessed 16 November 2004). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to GROVE ART: 
" Paperweight. 
Type of object, often ornamental, of hemispherical glass developed during the 19th century for holding down papers on desk tops. 
The decoration, suspended within the glass dome, appears mysteriously bent and magnified. 
Paperweights were popular in [LOC Europe] and were produced in large quantities from the 1840s until after 1850, and in the [LOC USA] from the 1850s. 
Typically, a gather of molten glass was dropped or blown into a shaped mould, then the preworked decorative base was heated and fused on top, with another gather of hot glass applied as a seal. 
The results were tipped out of the mould, then ground and polished. 
Paperweights range in diameter from 40–50 mm for miniatures to 100 mm and over for magnums, but the majority are 80–90 mm. 
The earliest paperweights enclosed engraved ceramic cameos and were made in [LOC Bohemia] from c. 
1830. 
About 1845 in [PER Murano, Venice], the glassmaker [PER Pietro Bigaglia] (1786–1876) produced the earliest millefiori paperweights, which fell out of favour c. 
1852 but were revived in the 1870s. 
However, the finest examples were produced in [LOC France] at the factories of the Compagnie des Verreries et Cristalleries de Saint-Louis, Baccarat and Clichy; good examples were also made at the [LOC Val-Saint-Lambert] and [LOC Louis Zoude] factories in the Seraign region in [LOC Belgium] (e.g. pom-pom millefiori, 1851; [LOC Charleroi], [ORG Mus]. 
[PER Verre A. & Tech]. 
). 
In [LOC Britain] Venetian-style paperweights were made principally in [LOC London] at the [ORG Whitefriars Glassworks] and in [LOC Birmingham] by [ORG George Bacchus & Co]. 
The first American-made weights—modelled after imported French examples—were produced in 1851 at the [ORG New England Glass Co.], [LOC Cambridge], [LOC MA], and later by such firms as the [ORG Boston & Sandwich Glass Co.], [LOC Cape Cod], [LOC MA], and [ORG Gillinder & Sons], [LOC Philadelphia], [LOC PA]. 
Costly ‘Favrile’ paperweights were produced in the 1890s by the [ORG Tiffany Glass Co]. 
Some 19th-century paperweights were high-domed or columnar and were often set into a pedestal base of wood or marble; some were blown or moulded into fruit shapes, and oversized weights, manufactured in [LOC Britain] from bottle-green glass, were used as doorstops. 
There are three main categories of 19th-century paperweights: millefiori, subjects and sulphides. 
Most numerous are the millefiori type wherein clusters of sliced, multicoloured glass canes are packed together (‘set-ups’) to form the base decoration. 
This ancient technique was revived and modified in Murano during the 16th century. 
The canes were made from rods of coloured glass, fused together and pulled to the required width. 
The canes were most frequently arranged in tight circles but often in loops, ‘poms-poms’ (clusters), chequers with criss-crossed lines, mushroom shapes, or laid against backgrounds of filigrana (filigree) designs. 
In ‘carpet’ millefiori paperweights the canes were interspersed with florets and canes enclosing silhouettes of animals, birds or initials running through their centre. ‘Scrambled’, ‘pell-mell’ or ‘macédoine’ weights enclosed millefiori canes massed together haphazardly and were combined with random twists of filigrana. 
These derive directly from 17th-century Venetian glass balls, intended to cool the hands. 
The glass was greenish in hue and packed with scrambled canes in dull greens, reds, ochre, white and black. 
Overlay (‘cased glass’) weights are rare. 
These were generally millefiori paperweights coated with one or two layers of an opaque coloured glass—usually red, blue or green—lined with white and cut with five or six facets, like windows (e.g. 
Baccarat double overlay paperweight, 1845–50; [LOC Corning], [LOC NY], Mus. 
Glass). 
A complicated millefiori paperweight might take up to a day to complete and comprise 180–220 canes; the stock of canes, however, might have taken several months to establish. 
Subject paperweights display naturalistic flowers, fruit, animals, birds, insects and such reptiles as lizards and snakes. 
The motifs were formed from heated glass rods, worked over an open flame or lamp (e.g. lampwork salamander with buttercup, late 1800s; [LOC Corning], [LOC NY], [ORG Mus]. 
Glass). 
Sulphides (encrusted cameos) often depict a famous person, an animal or mythological scene. 
The process first appeared in Bohemian glass before 1800 and was later perfected in [LOC France] by [PER Barthélemy Desprez] (fl 1773–1819). 
In 1819 the glassmaker [PER Apsley Pellatt II] (1791–1863) took out a patent for the production of sulphides at the Falcon glassworks in [LOC Southwark], [LOC London] (e.g. sulphide of [PER George III], c. 
1825–50; [LOC London], [ORG V&A]). 
Also popular were pinchbeck paperweights (1850s), especially in [LOC England], where a design in relief on a copper-and-zinc disc was enclosed in glass. 
Aventurine paperweights were made from an opaque Venetian glass (goldstone), combined with minute particles of copper oxide to give it sparkle. 
They were copied in [LOC France] in opaque-green glass and were later made in the [LOC USA]. 
A variety of different paperweights had star, chequer and strawberry diamond-cut bases; in many tinted-glass versions the cut-pattern constituted the sole design. 
Paperweight-making in both traditional and new styles was revived in the 1950s, and in the late 20th century paperweights were being made in [LOC France] at [LOC Baccarat] and [LOC St Louis]; in [LOC Britain], notably in [LOC Scotland]; in the [LOC Czech Republic]; in the [LOC USA], for example at [LOC Steuben], and in [LOC Sweden] at the Orrefors and Kosta glassworks. 
Hand-blown art paperweights were in vogue during the 1970s (e.g. brown mottled glass mushroom, [ORG Wedgwood], 1972; [LOC London], [ORG V&A]). 
" 
Additional excerpts are from an extensive entry on paperweights in THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GLASS by [PER Phoebe Phillips] ([LOC New York], [ORG Crown Publishers], Inc., 1981) pp. 
246-247: 
" Paperweights 
A Venetian writer, Sabellico, referred in 1494 to little balls of glass with all sorts of flowers, and we know from [PER Apsley Pellatt] (1894) that the Venetians decorated such spheres with herringbone patterns of small slices arranged in colourful sequence. 
Some balls seem to have been drilled, and were probably intended as a kind of pendant or elaborate bead for the centre of a necklace. 
By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, hundreds of designs were made into drawn-out rods for 'm illefiori' slices, and even more elaborate filigree patterns were twisted and spiralled to from the intricate 'reticello' and 've tro di trina' for stems, edgings and whole cups and platters. 
Paperweights became overwhelmingly popular from the 1840s onwards as items which sold in quantity through stationary stores, and corner shops, often for remarkably low prices. 
We associate them most commonly with the 'm illefiori' technique which was used to decorate most of the weights made during the classic period, the 1840s and 1850s. 
In fact " millefiori " work is one of the basic techniques, which also include lampwork, and enclosure or incrustation. 
The latter is the simplest of all, with the glass moulded and shaped around an already manufactured form such as a cameo or a miniature figure...

4-6.: 
" [PER Barrymore, Lionel], actor, was born in, [LOC Philadelphia], [LOC Pa.], Apr. 28, 1878, son of [PER Maurice] and [PER Georgiana (Drew) Barrymore]. 
His father (q.v.

Both of his parents, as well as his brother, [PER John], and sister, [PER Ethel Barrymore] (qq.v. 
), were actors, as was his matemal [ Ed: maternal] grandmother, [PER Louisa Lane Drew] (q.v. 
). 
[PER Lionel Barrymore] was educated at private schools, including [ORG Seton Hall Academy], [LOC East Orange], [LOC N.J.], and by tutors and made his debut on the stage as [PER Thomas] in  " The Rivals " in [LOC Kansas City], [LOC Mo.], in 1893 in a touring company headed by his grandmother and his uncle and aunt Mr. and [PER Mrs. Sidney Drew........Barrymore] was an accomplished etcher whose work was exhibited throughout the [LOC United States].......His etching ÎBoatyard in Venice' was chosen by the [ORG Society of American Etchers] as one of the ÎHundred Prints of the Year.'

And, the following information is from an article, " [ORG The American Artists Professional League] " by [PER A. T. Reid], ART DIGEST Vol. 
18 (March 1, 1944): p. 
28-29. 
" [PER Lionel Barrymore] DID NOT WANT TO BE AN ACTOR. 
HIS AMBITION WAS TO BE AN ARTIST. 
The [ORG American Artists Professional League] has elected [PER Lionel Barrymore] to its [ORG National Executive Committee]. 
In making the announcement at the [ORG League 's Annual Dinner] at [ORG Salmagundi Club] Saturday night, [PER Albert T. Reid], its National Vice-President, recalled [PER Barrymore] 's intentions to follow a career in art. 
Mr. [PER Reid] said: 
" It is my honor to make this formal announcement that [PER Lionel Barrymore], an outstanding figure of the American stage and screen, who with his brilliant and talented family has won everlasting fame in the theatre of the world, has graciously accepted a place on your Executive Board of the [ORG American Artists Professional League]. 
But it is not in recognition of his eminent achievements as an actor that the League sought Mr. [PER Barrymore] to become one of us. 
Nothing we might do could add one bit of luster to that fame. 
It is because he has achieved outstanding skill in the profession of art - his first great love and ambition that he had to relegate to a second place in order to make a living. 
Comparatively few of his millions of admirers are aware of his art and most of those who knew anything about it looked upon it as a hobby. 
So, the League, fully conscious of Mr. [PER Barrymore] 's ability in the line of his greatest ambition, and with a desire to help point the finger of recognition to his art, is now doing honor to him - though we feel in all humility, he is honoring us....... 
A number of years ago...A half dozen young fellows met after the theatre in a corner place at 8th and Walnut Streets, in [LOC Kansas City]. 
It was a little party promoted by [PER Ed Allen], a brilliant Kanasas [ Ed: Kansas] City writer and dramatic critic, in honor of a personable and likeable young actor named [PER Lionel Barrymore]....'  
That night is indelibly stamped on my memory, with the stories and varied ambitions of that bunch of talented and energetic young fellows. 
But it was [PER Lionel] 's talk and discussions that impressed me and stuck with me all this time.... 
'...he amazed them by declaring he had no ambition to be an actor. 
He wanted to be an artist. 
He was on the stage as a means toward the end. 
He wanted to draw, draw, draw, and he made sweeping gestures with his hands, -- 'Like this and this, --like Remington paints.' 
'There is little difference between acting and art, he told us. 
He said it is all holding a mirror up to nature....... 
'He saved money from his acting and went abroad to study art--until his funds gave out. 
He came back and tried in the field of illustration, but as many others have learned, the remuneration for beginners failed to provide the regular eating schedule required for a healthy six-foot bunch of energy. 
So, back to the stage-- and to stage immortality. 
But he kept industriously busy in his spare moments with his pencils, brushes and etching tools until he gained a superb mastery over them....... 
'It is, therefore, with great pleasure I am privileged to read this telegram from Mr. Barrymore: 
" '[LOC Culver City], [LOC Calif.], Feb. 3, 1944. 
I deeply appreciate the high honor. 
Screen commitments make impossible a trip to [LOC New York] for the League Annual Dinner. 
Election to your Board would make me very proud as I have always regarded your organization as one of the important factors in American art. 
Please accept my sincere thanks and rest assured of whatever cooperation I may be able to give.--Lionel Barrymore' " 
Let us all stand in welcome of [PER Lionel Barrymore] to the [ORG American Artists Professional League].'

On the subject of etching, the following definition--from [MISC A DICTIONARY OF ART TERMS AND TECHNIQUES] by [PER Ralph Mayer] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Crowell], 1969) --should prove helpful: 
" etching. 
BITING; or the process whereby a surface is partially eaten away by a MORDANT in order to create a design, either as decoration, as on glass, or as an INTAGLIO or RELIEF PRINTING surface on a metal plate. 
In the latter capacity, etching is the process used to prepare the printing surface of the metal plates used in ANASTATIC PRINTING, PHOTOENGRAVING (both line and HALFTONE), and PHOTO GRAVURE, as well as the plates made for the specific fine arts print-making technique that is known as etching (see below). 
Etching is a chemical process and differs, therefore, from the mechanical methods of creating a raised or lowered design on a surface, as in ENGRAVING. 
The intaglio printmaking process that is known as etching is, traditionally, the preeminent graphic arts technique.... 
The PROOFS are printed, or pulled, by running the inked plate and sheets of damp paper through an ETCHING PRESS.... 
Because of the variety of techniques and materials available to the etcher and because etching can be very successfully used in combination with other techniques such as DRYPOINT and AQUATINT, etching permits a multiplicity of effects and allows for a completely individual artistic expression.... 
During the 17th century, particularly in the hands of two virtuoso etchers,... etching so progressed in versatility of technique and subtlety of effect that it surpassed engraving as the most popular graphic art.... 
Etching innovations in the 18th century, such as CRAYON MANNER and aquatint, were taken up in [LOC Spain] by [PER Goya] (1746-1828) -certainly one of the greatest masters of the technique of etching.... 
The great 19th-century painter-etchers, among them [PER James McNeill Whistler] and [PER Joseph Pennell], obtained new effects with etching. 
[PER Picasso], [PER Rouault], and [PER Chagall] are among the significant 20th-century painter-etchers. 
" 
[ Editor truncated copyrighted text above] 
And lastly, the following brief definition of " etching " is from ARTLEX (http://www.artlex.com/>), an online dictionary of art terms: 
" etching - An intaglio printing process in which an etching needle is used to draw into a wax ground applied over a metal plate. 
The plate is then submerged in a series of acid baths, each biting into the metal surface only where unprotected by the ground. 
The ground is removed, ink is forced into the etched depressions, the unetched surfaces wiped, and an impression is printed. 

Also, both the design etched on a plate and an impression made from an etched plate. 
Too often confused with engraving.

" Spirituality " (6 article special section) [MISC NEW ART EXAMINER] (vol. 
26, no.6, Mar. 1999, p.16-45) 
Abstract: " A special section on spirituality in art. 
Articles discuss a range of topics, including the very idea of " spirituality " in art, the diverse ways in which the word " spiritual " is applied to contemporary art, the Wicca religion, how [MISC Roman Catholicism] has impacted on the work of a number of 20th-century artists, and the spirituality of a number of famous artists.

Abstract: " The writer discusses the relationship of the spiritual with 20th-century art and science. 
He begins by examining the presence of the spiritual in modern art, citing the work of art historian [PER Roger Lipsey], who posited the notion that the arrival of the abstract in modern art brought about a new exploration of the spiritual and identified Theosophy as one of the most important spiritual influences of the time. 
He then considers the influence of the spiritual on three artistic groupings: [PER Wassily Kandinsky] and the [ORG Bauhaus School], the American Abstract Expressionists, and contemporary electronic and body artists. 
He goes on to discuss the influence of the spiritual in modern science, considering first the approach to the relationship between science and spiritual based on quantum theory as exemplified by the work of physicist [PER Paul Davies], and then discussing the approach based on the " anthropic principle " as developed by [PER Frank Tipler].

An alcoholic for many years, [PER Stewart] was on the brink of death when he began painting. 
Four years on, his art constitutes his therapy. 
Like many alcoholics and drug addicts who talk of a " higher power " that guides them, [PER Stewart] 's work is a spiritual art ; he paints from another dimension in worship of a greater power. 
In this sense, his work is very similar to that of Islamic artists such as the contemporary painter [PER Suad al-Attar], whose work also has a spiritual dimension.

Your topic is interesting but extremely broad. 
Regrettably, the Ask [PER Joan of Art] reference service cannot provide the essay length answer you need due to our high volume of questions. 
However, let me get you started on your research by suggesting general resources that will help you define your subject. 
In terms of representations of the Bible in American art, there are 286 works in the collection of the [ORG Smithsonian American Art Museum] based on religious themes. 
You can view these works by going to the museum 's website at: 
http://americanart.si.edu/ 
From this homepage, click on " Collections and Exhibitions" on the left side of the page. 
From there, click on " Browse the Collection " and scroll down the page to click on the category of " Religious Themes. 
" 
You might also be interested in the following excerpts from a lengthy article on " Religion and Art, " in [MISC GROVE ART] http://www.groveart.com/ (accessed 29 December 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]:[ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [ORG GROVE ART]: 
" Religion and Art. 
Art has played an integral role in the development of all world religions. 
As the visualization of experiences, stories and aspirations, art translates into perceptible imagery what it means to be human, while religion, as the spiritual inspiration for human creativity and culture, binds together humanity and divinity through ritual and mythology... 
Works of art can 'capture' the meaning or import of a ritual or religious experience and, by 'freezing it' in form, allow for the (possible) repetition of the original ritual or religious experience... 
Religion both as a path to salvation and as spiritual inspiration supports the desire and the fundamental human need for creative expression. 
When authentic religious intentions are expressed through images, art becomes religious communication, and this unique form of communication reinforces religious beliefs, customs and values. 
1. 
Basic relationships. 
The relationships between religion and art have always been fraught with ambiguities, controversies and diversities, but the foundation of all these relationships has been the issue of power - social, political and economic as well as spiritual. 
There are at least five ways of defining these relationships: authoritarian, oppositionist, mutual, separatist and unified. 
Those relationships in which religion dominates art, that is where art is placed in a secondary position serving the needs of religion, are described as authoritarian. 
In such a relationship, there is no room for artistic creativity or originality ; rather both art and the artists are vehicles employed by a higher authority, and the art can be defined as visual Propaganda. 
Whenever art and religion are in situations of equal authority, that is when one is not subservient to the other, the relationship may be categorized as one of opposition. 
In such cases, art and religion are co-dependent and each attempts to dominate the other. 
Another form of co-dependent relationship might be described as mutual, that is when religion and art, being of equal status in a culture, work together in a symbiosis of nurture and creative inspiration. 
The relationship between religion and art best characterized as separatist occurs whenever religion and art operate independently of and without regard for each other. 
Those religious traditions described as iconoclastic or cultures whose art is identified as secular would exemplify this 's eparation'. 
Finally, in the relationship identified as unified, religion and art became fused into one identity, making it impossible to distinguish where the art begins and the religious tradition ends. 
Just as there is no universally accepted definition of either art or religion, there is no clearcut or consistent attitude in any religion towards art. 
Such attitudes vary within the same religious tradition and among different religious traditions within the same culture. 
In fact, as the phenomenologist of religion [PER Gerardus van der Leeuw] has indicated, one religious tradition could be identified, simultaneously or historically, within all the categories described above...

This site consists of an extensive listing of links arranged by art historical period. 
You might want to begin by developing a good definition of Renaissance art for yourself. 
For example, consider what aspects in art were unique to the Renaissance. 
Then track how those aspects have been continued. 
Your question is interesting and involves many factors, such as fine art vs. craft, aesthetic value, historic and cultural value. 
The following information provides some basic definitions of " art " as well as provides a larger insight into some of the issues that surround this definition, which can help you to form your own opinions on the matter. 
The best place to start would be with some definitions: 
The following entry is from the online version of [MISC THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA (BRITANNICA ONLINE)] (accessed 14 April 2003) : 
" fine art 
any of the non-utilitarian visual arts, or arts concerned primarily with the creation of beauty and generally taken to include painting, printmaking, sculpture, and architecture, with literature, music, and dance sometimes being added. 
In its strict sense, fine art is to be distinguished from such decorative arts and crafts as wall painting, pottery, weaving, metalworking, and furniture making, all of which have utility as an end (the architect being differentiated from the builder in this respect). 
Popular and primitive art, and indeed art up to the end of the [ORG Middle Ages in Europe], served without embarrassment some purpose beyond the pure enjoyment of beauty. 
The distinction between artist and craftsman hardly appears before the Renaissance, and the term fine arts, or beaux-arts in [LOC France], does not appear until the mid-18th century. 
By then the founding of academies had given impetus to the concept of fine art as creation on a loftier level untrammeled by secondary considerations, but the most stringent distinction between fine and applied art belongs to the 19th century. 
" 
Another definition is from [MISC ARTLEX] (http://www.artlex.com/ [ August 2003]), an online dictionary of art terms: 
" art - For numerous reasons, the most difficult word to define without starting endless argument ! 
Many definitions have been proposed. 
At least art involves a degree of human involvement-- through manual skills or thought-- as with the word " artificial, " meaning made by humans instead of by nature. 
Definitions vary in how they divide all that is artificial into what is and isn't art. 
The most common means is to rely upon the estimations of art experts and institutions. 
More useful may be to see definitions of aesthetics, the arts, beaux-arts, craft, high art, and low art. 
Quotations about art, including others' definitions of art. 
" 
another definition from ARTLEX:
" high art - fine art, also known as beaux-arts, art that is of universal transcendence, having withstood the test of time and representing the epitome of artistic achievement, as opposed to low art, which is also known as mass culture. 
Until recently, a distinction was commonly made between high and low art. 
Traditionally, high art consists of the meticulous expression in fine materials of refined or noble sentiment, appreciation of the former depending on such things as intelligence, social standing, educated taste, and a willingness to be challenged. 
Low art is the shoddy manufacturing in inferior materials of superficial kitsch, simply catering to popular taste, unreflective acceptance of realism, and a certain 'couch potato' mentality. 
Although many earlier artists took inspiration from popular and folkart, the most systematic approaches towards blurring the differences between high and low art were taken by Cubism, Dada and Surrealism. 
Pop Art further weakened the distinction, and artists as various as [PER Jean-Michel Basquiat]  (American, 1960-1988), [PER Jeff Koons]  (American, 1955-) and the [ORG Guerrilla Girls]  (American), influenced strongly by the different branches of postmodern thought, have dealt it the further blows. 
It is not surprising, given for example that the song O Superman by performance artist [PER Laurie Anderson]  (American, 1947-) reached the top ten of the pop charts in the [LOC U.S.] and [LOC England], that video and camera artist [PER William Wegman]  (American) has appeared on television 's The Tonight Show to promote a book of photographs, and that both have done segments on Saturday Night Live. 
In spite of this, one still wonders if the distinction still exists, albeit in a slightly different form. 
Few would seriously argue that the droves who follow televised wrestling matches and afternoon soap operas have any genuine interest in contemporary art. 
It is even less likely that the millions who read supermarket tabloids or romance novels would ever choose to read advanced art criticism. 
" 
A third interpretation is from [MISC A DICTIONARY OF ART TERMS AND TECHNIQUES] by [PER Ralph Mayer]  (New [ORG York: Barnes & Noble], 1981) : 
" fine art. 
Art created primarily as an aesthetic expression, to be contemplated or enjoyed for its own sake. 
Unlike APPLIED ART, it is not used as an instrument for some other activity. 
Examples of fine art include painting, drawwing [ Editor: drawing], sculpture, print making, and architecture. 
The distinctions between fine and applied art are, however, arbitrary, at best. 
For instance, a Greek vase or a medieval manuscript illumination that may have been functional at the time of its creation is enjoyed today as a purely aesthetic object. 
" 
The analysis of art as being good or bad is a difficult task. 
A great deal of information has been published on the evaluation, analysis and critique of art, which addresses issues such as what is considered " good art ", the shifting tastes and popularity of different types of art based on public demand and the art market, and general issues related to the appreciation of art. 
For starters, you might be interested in the following article from [MISC GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 14 April 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
" Aesthetics. 
Branch of Western philosophy concerned primarily with the arts, especially the fine arts, although it often treats the concepts of natural beauty and appreciation of nature as well.... 
I. Introduction. 
The primary subject-matter of aesthetics is the complex cultural institution in which works of art are embedded, including artistic creation, performance, appreciation, interpretation, criticism, judgement, and the various roles the arts play in people 's lives and in society.... 
1. 
Defining art. 
The central question of aesthetics, according to some, is what art is, what works of art have in common and how they differ from non-art (see Art).... 
There has been considerable skepticism about the possibility of defining art, or of defining it in a useful and illuminating way. 
The diversity of what is commonly called art, as well as the variety of definitions that have been suggested, the often striking similarities between some kinds of art and some things, or activities, that are not usually considered art, the absence of a clear correlation between the notion of art in non-Western and pre-18th-century cultures, and also the dramatic shifts in uses of the term in recent Western culture, can easily make it seem that any definition will be arbitrary and pointless.... 
Uncertainties about how to define art translate into uncertainties about the scope of aesthetics.... 
2. 
Objectivity and subjectivity. 
Much discussion has focused on questions about the objectivity or subjectivity of aesthetic judgements. 
Some speak of a 's cience' of criticism whose task is to ascertain objective facts about works of art and regard aesthetic judgements, when true, as expressing such facts.... 
[PER David Hume] articulated a dilemma that vexed [PER Immanuel Kant] and many others: aesthetic judgements seem to be mere matters of taste, there being nothing in the object to make them correct or incorrect ; so no-one has a right to demand the agreement of others.... 
3. 
Values. 
Aesthetics is sometimes classified as a branch of value theory, along with ethics.... 
The most obvious ones concern evaluative judgements of particular works: judgements that a work is good, great, successful, mediocre, or better or worse than another.... 
In addition to questions about the merit of particular works, one can ask about the value of the institution of art as a whole, the reasons why people engage in it and the benefits they derive from it - or the ills that it is responsible for.... 
Some consider the values of the arts - either of particular works or of the institution - to be primarily cognitive ; others consider them primarily emotive.... 
There are sharp differences among aestheticians about how special the arts are, how closely they are linked to other interests and integrated into the rest of life.... 
There has been a strong tendency, however, deriving partly from [PER Kant] but especially prominent in the late 19th century and early 20th, to regard art as essentially autonomous from the rest of life, to think of the arts as inhabiting a separate domain with its own distinctive intrinsic values.... 
4. 
Art and art-making. 
There is a nest of traditional problems concerning whether and to what extent what is important about art is located in works of art themselves, whether the artist and his act of creation, or more broadly the manner and circumstances in which the work came about, come into play, and in what ways they do.... 
Contrary views take many forms. 
Some have regarded art as essentially a matter of communication between the artist and appreciators, with the work serving as a vehicle of such communication.... 
[PER Ernst Gombrich] and [PER Nelson Goodman], among others, contend that a work of art is to be understood in a certain language or in terms of certain conventions, and that identifying the relevant language or conventions requires going beyond a work 's intrinsic properties (see also Iconography and iconology ; Semiotics ; and Symbol).... 
5. 
Aesthetics and practice. 
Many important questions of aesthetics are specific to particular genres, media or styles of art, and many of them grow naturally out of the concerns of artists and critics.... 
Other practical matters that lead quickly to larger theoretical concerns for aestheticians include questions about Authenticity and Forgery.... 
Other practical matters that lead quickly to larger theoretical concerns include questions about relations between form and function in architecture and design, about pornography and censorship, about public support for the arts, about choices between 'high art' and popular art, and about the nature and validity of the test of time for greatness in art...

According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
" Religion and art. 
Art has played an integral role in the development of all world religions. 
As the visualization of experiences, stories and aspirations, art translates into perceptible imagery what it means to be human, while religion, as the spiritual inspiration for human creativity and culture, binds together humanity and divinity through ritual and mythology. 
In the exercise of rituals and the narration of mythology, religion and art coincide both in theory and in practice.... 
When authentic religious intentions are expressed through images, art becomes religious communication, and this unique form of communication reinforces religious beliefs, customs and values. 
1. 
Basic relationships. 
The relationships between religion and art have always been fraught with ambiguities, controversies and diversities, but the foundation of all these relationships has been the issue of power - social, political and economic as well as spiritual. 
There are at least five ways of defining these relationships: authoritarian, oppositionist, mutual, separatist and unified.... 
Finally, in the relationship identified as unified, religion and art became fused into one identity, making it impossible to distinguish where the art begins and the religious tradition ends. 
Just as there is no universally accepted definition of either art or religion, there is no clearcut or consistent attitude in any religion towards art.... the phenomenologist of religion... has indicated, one religious tradition could be identified, simultaneously or historically, within all the categories described above...

He begins by examining the presence of the spiritual in modern art, citing the work of art historian [PER Roger Lipsey], who posited the notion that the arrival of the abstract in modern art brought about a new exploration of the spiritual and identified Theosophy as one of the most important spiritual influences of the time. 
He then considers the influence of the spiritual on three artistic groupings: [PER Wassily Kandinsky] and the [ORG Bauhaus School], the American Abstract Expressionists, and contemporary electronic and body artists. 
He goes on to discuss the influence of the spiritual in modern science, considering first the approach to the relationship between science and spiritual based on quantum theory as exemplified by the work of physicist [PER Paul Davies], and then discussing the approach based on the " anthropic principle " as developed by [PER Frank Tipler].

Abstract: " The writer compares the work of the artist [PER Alex Stewart] to that of the Iraqi artist [PER Suad al-Attar]. 
An alcoholic for many years, [PER Stewart] was on the brink of death when he began painting. 
Four years on, his art constitutes his therapy. 
Like many alcoholics and drug addicts who talk of a " higher power " that guides them, [PER Stewart] 's work is a spiritual art ; he paints from another dimension in worship of a greater power. 
In this sense, his work is very similar to that of Islamic artists such as the contemporary painter [PER Suad al-Attar], whose work also has a spiritual dimension. 
Both [PER Stewart] and [PER Suad] use their art to articulate their experiences ; [PER Suad] 's paintings represent her spirituality, her sensuality, and her religion, and [PER Stewart] 's paintings depict what it is to be freed from alcohol addiction.

" Art history. 
Knowledge or study of the visual arts within a historical framework, the nature and breadth of which have been the subject of much discussion. 
Although earlier accounts of art and of aesthetics had suggested or implied the appropriateness and possibility of tracing patterns of historical development within the visual arts, it was perhaps only in the 19th century that a concerted attempt was made to give art history a philosophical basis. 
As art history subsequently became increasingly linked to and rooted in academic and educational institutions, it was accompanied by a shift in the status of the art historian, who came to be seen as the exponent of an increasingly sophisticated and specialized professional practice. 
Partly as a result of this increased specialization, and partly as a result of cross-fertilization with other disciplines, at the end of the 20th century art history in the Western world was characterized by a pluralism of approaches and by an acceptance of this pluralism as a corrective to what some perceived as a misguided earlier attempt to give a single comprehensive and universal account of art....

We also can not provide personal opinions. 
However, I can get you started in your research into this topic, which can help you to form your own opinions on the matter. 
The best place to start would be with some definitions: 
The following entry is from the online version of THE [MISC ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA (BRITANNICA ONLINE)] (accessed 14 May 2003) [ Ed: subscription service] : 
" fine art 
any of the non-utilitarian visual arts, or arts concerned primarily with the creation of beauty and generally taken to include painting, printmaking, sculpture, and architecture, with literature, music, and dance sometimes being added. 
In its strict sense, fine art is to be distinguished from such decorative arts and crafts as wall painting, pottery, weaving, metalworking, and furniture making, all of which have utility as an end (the architect being differentiated from the builder in this respect). 
Popular and primitive art, and indeed art up to the end of the Middle Ages in Europe, served without embarrassment some purpose beyond the pure enjoyment of beauty. 
The distinction between artist and craftsman hardly appears before the Renaissance, and the term fine arts, or beaux-arts in [LOC France], does not appear until the mid-18th century. 
By then the founding of academies had given impetus to the concept of fine art as creation on a loftier level untrammeled by secondary considerations, but the most stringent distinction between fine and applied art belongs to the 19th century. 
" 
Another definition is from [MISC ARTLEX] (http://www.artlex.com/ [ July 2003]), an online dictionary of art terms: 
" art - For numerous reasons, the most difficult word to define without starting endless argument ! 
Many definitions have been proposed. 
At least art involves a degree of human involvement-- through manual skills or thought-- as with the word " artificial, " meaning made by humans instead of by nature. 
Definitions vary in how they divide all that is artificial into what is and isn't art. 
The most common means is to rely upon the estimations of art experts and institutions. 
More useful may be to see definitions of aesthetics, the arts, beaux-arts, craft, high art, and low art. 
Quotations about art, including others' definitions of art. 
" 
another definition from ARTLEX: 
" high art - fine art, also known as beaux-arts, art that is of universal transcendence, having withstood the test of time and representing the epitome of artistic achievement, as opposed to low art, which is also known as mass culture. 
Until recently, a distinction was commonly made between high and low art. 
Traditionally, high art consists of the meticulous expression in fine materials of refined or noble sentiment, appreciation of the former depending on such things as intelligence, social standing, educated taste, and a willingness to be challenged. 
Low art is the shoddy manufacturing in inferior materials of superficial kitsch, simply catering to popular taste, unreflective acceptance of realism, and a certain 'couch potato' mentality. 
Although many earlier artists took inspiration from popular and folk art, the most systematic approaches towards blurring the differences between high and low art were taken by Cubism, Dada and Surrealism. 
Pop Art further weakened the distinction, and artists as various as [PER Jean-Michel Basquiat]  (American, 1960-1988), [PER Jeff Koons]  (American, 1955-) and the [ORG Guerrilla Girls]  (American), influenced strongly by the different branches of postmodern thought, have dealt it the further blows. 
It is not surprising, given for example that the song O Superman by performance artist [PER Laurie Anderson]  (American, 1947-) reached the top ten of the pop charts in the [LOC U.S.] and [LOC England], that video and camera artist [PER William Wegman]  (American) has appeared on television 's The Tonight Show to promote a book of photographs, and that both have done segments on Saturday Night Live. 
In spite of this, one still wonders if the distinction still exists, albeit in a slightly different form. 
Few would seriously argue that the droves who follow televised wrestling matches and afternoon soap operas have any genuine interest in contemporary art. 
It is even less likely that the millions who read supermarket tabloids or romance novels would ever choose to read advanced art criticism. 
" 
The analysis of art as being good or bad is a difficult task. 
A great deal of information has been published on the evaluation, analysis and critique of art, which addresses issues such as what is considered " good art ", the shifting tastes and popularity of different types of art based on public demand and the art market, and general issues related to the appreciation of art.

The notion of fine art and that of a corresponding branch of philosophy are of relatively recent origin, dating from the 18th century, although historical antecedents of many of the particular issues now recognized as belonging to aesthetics go back to antiquity. 
The present usage of the term stems from its adoption in 1735 by [PER Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten], who employed the Greek aisthesis (perception) to distinguish the study of sensory, perceptual concerns, such as beauty, from logic, the study of reason and intellect. 
I. Introduction. 
The primary subject-matter of aesthetics is the complex cultural institution in which works of art are embedded, including artistic creation, performance, appreciation, interpretation, criticism, judgement, and the various roles the arts play in people 's lives and in society.... 
1. 
Defining art. 
The central question of aesthetics, according to some, is what art is, what works of art have in common and how they differ from non-art (see Art).... 
2. 
Objectivity and subjectivity. 
Much discussion has focused on questions about the objectivity or subjectivity of aesthetic judgements.... 
3. 
Values. 
Aesthetics is sometimes classified as a branch of value theory, along with ethics.... 
4. 
Art and art-making. 
There is a nest of traditional problems concerning whether and to what extent what is important about art is located in works of art themselves, whether the artist and his act of creation, or more broadly the manner and circumstances in which the work came about, come into play, and in what ways they do.... 
5. 
Aesthetics and practice. 
Many important questions of aesthetics are specific to particular genres, media or styles of art, and many of them grow naturally out of the concerns of artists and critics.... 
Other practical matters that lead quickly to larger theoretical concerns include questions about relations between form and function in architecture and design, about pornography and censorship, about public support for the arts, about choices between 'high art' and popular art, and about the nature and validity of the test of time for greatness in art...

Despite the role that aesthetics plays in the evaluation of art, whether or not an artwork is " good " or " bad " remains highly subjective.

[MISC JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS & ART CRITICISM]. v. 54, Spring 1996, p. 
105-15. 
Abstract 
The writer discusses the achievement of Kantian art critic [PER Clement Greenberg] against the background of a distinction between aesthetic objects and works of art. 
He suggests that [PER Greenberg] 's way of doing art criticism has become extremely problematic in an art world almost defined by [PER Marcel Duchamp] as its generative thinker. 
He points out that [PER Greenberg] 's aesthetic philosophy is being carried forward by [PER Hilton Kramer] and that it pivots precisely on " quality in art, " an issue that [PER Kramer] identifies specifically with aesthetic quality but that [PER Duchamp] and his followers would identify in some other way. 
He sides with the latter, sensing that it is bad critical practice to dismiss works that lack aesthetic goodness in [PER Greenberg] 's terms as aesthetically bad. 
He demonstrates how [PER Greenberg] 's strengths and weaknesses as a critic derive from two Kantian tenets: the " unchangeableness of art " and the separation of the aesthetic from the instrumental.

Part of a special section on aesthetics in art and criticism. 
The writer discusses the idea of quality in art. 
The terms beauty and quality imply that too much attention is paid to the mere appearance of art. 
However, if a piece of visual art is to get a second look, it must have a trace of beauty no matter how righteous the cause, indignant the tone, or oppressed the artist is.

Abstract 
[PER Morley Safer] 's blanket condemnation of contemporary art on 60 Minutes a few weeks ago was simplistic. 
The show lumped together artists as different in age, temperament, and quality as [PER Cy Twombly] and [PER Jeff Koons], [PER Gerhard Richter] and [PER Robert Gober], [PER Robert Ryman] and [PER Felix Gonzalez-Torres] -- as if there were the slightest connection between them.

Abstract 
The art world is still dealing with the fallout from [PER Morley Safer] 's sarcastic segment " Yes...

[PER Koons], the focus of the attack and the only artist interviewed, probably benefited from the broadcast because it gave national exposure to his work and his own analysis of it.

Abstract 
An article excerpted from the book Culture or Trash ? 
The only way to free ourselves of the lugubrious cycle that has vitiated the visual arts for almost 20 years is to reclaim the right to criticize art. 
[PER Morley Safer] of 60 Minutes evoked strong opposition when he virulently assaulted the arts in a recent program. 
His report may have lacked finesse, but he raised the issue of the swollen self-importance of so much contemporary art and the almost religious awe in which it is often held. 
Art is glamorized today in films, plays, and periodicals in a way that it never was before. 
Despite this adulation, today 's art is much less impressive than in the past.

Abstract 
At the heart of the sad quality of new art in the last fifteen years lies a misguided and exploitive attitude toward the past. 
The 1950s saw a temporary retreat to academicism as instant approval was awarded to works that were actually only mimicking, and ultimately degrading, what had been original in the expressionist works of [PER Kirchner] and [PER Nolde]. 
Today, art is suffering from a relapse. 
Derivative, referential work by painters like [PER David Salle] is being touted as avant-garde, when it is in fact merely a reversion to the academicism of the nineteenth century. 
Current architecture also suffers from the work of artists who misunderstand and misuse the discoveries of the past.

Abstract 
Art critics are crucial to the vitality of the art world, but they have almost no direct influence on art. 
Some critics choose to champion an artist or school, while others stand above the fray, finding all art to be grand. 
The former cannot hope to use their writing to inspire great works, and the latter have abdicated their duty to pass responsible judgment. 
By establishing no criteria for excellence, the art world becomes dull. 
More critics and publications should judge art rather than serve as friends and accomplices of artists and dealers.

 (July 1996) : 7. 
Abstract:
The British artist [PER Robert Clark] discusses the difficulty of assessing the quality of contemporary art works. 
He outlines his approach to assessing his own art and explains how he encourages his students to constantly reassess their current work in the light of their past work, and that of other artists. 
With reference to his own critical writing, [PER Clark] rejects the concept that the critic is the final authority on the quality of an art work and states that existing 's tandards of excellence' cannot be applied to innovative new art. 
He comments on [PER Joseph Beuys] 's statement that everybody is an artist and argues that critical responsibility lies with the artist rather than the art critic or writer.

No. 23 (Autumn 1997) : 29-30. 
Abstract:
Argues that the trend towards the democratization of art since the 1960s has had negative repercussions for the quality of art and the amount of public funding available for high-quality art. 
With particular reference to developments in theatre in [LOC Switzerland], the author explains that the establishment of alternative arts organizations has encouraged ever more people to seek self-expression through the arts, often primarily for social and political, rather than aesthetic, purposes. 
The associated abandonment of the elitist hierarchies previously used to discriminate quality in art has led to all artists to expect equal support from public funds, regardless of the artistic merits of their projects. 
In such a scenario, the author asserts, criteria must be developed for use in judging which artists and projects merit public funding, and which do not. 
He suggests that reasonable criteria would eschew definitions of professionalism and quality that are likely to change with time, and attempt to relate quality to specific public needs and to provide fixed-length subsidies for priority projects.

Abstract:
Consideration of what constitutes advance in art, what innovations are progressing art, and what criteria can be applied to developments in art to answer this question. 
The author argues that contemporary artists live in a climate where to be radical is intellectually de rigeur, and to show any respect in their work for tradition suspect. 
To be modern means not ascribing value to art of pre-modern times, contemporary artists adhering only to passing fashions. 
Contemporary works are judged on their detached modernness rather than on aesthetic grounds. 
The author suggests that there are two streams of art currently at work in [LOC Britain] - the modern, which rejects any connection with past traditions, and the non-modern, which tries to work within those traditions. 
Both should be collected by national institutions.

It is possible that your topic is too narrow ; you may need to broaden it to include all 20th or 21st century artists who have depicted [MISC Jewish] holidays in their art.

The following background information on Romanticism in general from [PER Ralph Mayer] 's [MISC A DICTIONARY OF ART TERMS AND TECHNIQUES] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Thomas Crowell], 1969) should get you started: 
" Romanticism. 
An approach to art that emphasizes the personal, the emotional, and the dramatic, which it often expresses through the use of exotic, literary, or historically remote subject matter. 
In the 19th century, the Romantic movement arose as a reaction to the austerity of Neoclassicism and as an expression of the spirit of revolution that characterized the age. 
In painting, [PER Eugene Delacroix]  (1798-1863) and [PER Theodore Gericault]  (1791-1824) in [LOC France] and [PER J. M. W. Turner]  (1775-1851) in [LOC England] were leading Romantics. 
In sculpture, [PER Francois Rude]  (1784-1855) and [PER Antoine-Louis Barye]  (1795-1875) are notable. 
Art historians use the words classicism and Romanticism in a general sense for basic and opposing attitudes in art and architecture. 
Both classical and romantic influences are sometimes seen in the work of a single artist or school...

To get a good overview of art historical periods, such as Romanticism, I suggest that you browse through one of the following general resources that you can find in many public, school, and university libraries:

First, I have provided definitions of each of the three terms from ARTLEX (http://www.artlex.com [ February 2004]), an online dictionary of art terms. 
You will want to visit this website yourself to view numerous examples of relevant artworks: 
“high art - Fine art, also known as beaux-arts, art that is of universal transcendence, having withstood the test of time and representing the epitome of artistic achievement, as opposed to low art, which is also known as mass culture. 
Until recently, a distinction was typically made between high and low art. 
Traditionally, high art consists of the meticulous expression in fine materials of refined or noble sentiment, appreciation of the former depending on such things as intelligence, social standing, educated taste, and a willingness to be challenged. 
Low art is the shoddy manufacturing in inferior materials of superficial kitsch, simply catering to popular taste, unreflective acceptance of realism, and a certain " couch potato " mentality. 
Although many earlier artists took inspiration from popular and folk art, the most systematic approaches towards blurring the differences between high and low art were taken by Cubism, Dada and Surrealism. 
Pop Art further weakened the distinction, and artists as various as [PER Jean-Michel Basquiat]  (American, 1960-1988), [PER Jeff Koons]  (American, 1955-) and the [ORG Guerrilla Girls]  (American), influenced strongly by the different branches of postmodern thought, have dealt it the further blows. 
It is not surprising, given for example that the song [ORG O Superman] by performance artist [PER Laurie Anderson]  (American, 1947-) reached the top ten of the pop charts in the [LOC U.S.] and [LOC England], that video and camera artist [PER William Wegman]  (American, contemporary) has appeared on television 's The Tonight Show to promote a book of photographs, and that both have done segments on Saturday Night Live. 
In spite of this, one still wonders if the distinction still exists, albeit in a slightly different form. 
Few would seriously argue that the droves who follow televised wrestling matches and afternoon soap operas have any genuine interest in contemporary art. 
It is even less likely that the millions who read supermarket tabloids or romance novels would ever choose to read advanced art criticism.” 
“Pop Art - An art movement and style that had its origins in [LOC England] in the 1950s and made its way to the [LOC United States] during the 1960s. 
Pop artists have focused attention upon familiar images of the popular culture such as billboards, comic strips, magazine advertisements, and supermarket products. 
Leading exponents are [PER Richard Hamilton]  (British, 1922-), [PER Andy Warhol]  (American, 1928 ? 1930 ? -1987), [PER Roy Lichtenstein]  (American, 1923-1997), [PER Claes Oldenburg]  (American, 1929-), [PER Jasper Johns]  (American, 1930-), and [PER Robert Rauschenberg]  (American, 1925-).” 
“kitsch - Art characterized by vapidly sentimental, often pretentious poor taste.

===

It is typically clumsy, repetitive, cheesy, and slickly commercial. 
Artists whose works have been considered kitsch are [PER William-Adolphe Bouguereau]  (French, 1825-1905), [PER Maxfield Parrish]  (American, 1870-1966), and [PER Norman Rockwell]  (American, 1894-1978). 
Although their works are more seriously considered and even admired by art critics and historians today, there are many other artists whose works continue to be labeled kitsch. 
Among contemporary examples, the work of [PER Thomas Kinkade]  (American, 1958-), whose frothing oceans, idyllic cottages and feverishly colorful gardens bear titles like The Blessings of Spring and Hometown Evening, have been called kitsch. 
His website, nevertheless says that he 's " [LOC America] 's most collected living artist, " and the corporation that bears his name, and manufactures photographic reproductions of his paintings (adding actual brushstrokes to many of them), has been making annual profits in the millions of dollars for several years. 
 (pr. kitsh) ” 
And the following two definitions are from [MISC THE PRESTEL DICTIONARY OF ART AND ARTISTS OF THE 20TH CENTURY] ([LOC Munich] ; [LOC New York]:[ORG Prestel], 2000) :

“Pop art. 
Art movement that began primarily in [LOC Great Britain] and the [LOC US] in 1956 in reaction to the values and transmission of mass media culture. 
It was preceded by a rediscovery of Dadaist techniques and ideas as practiced at the [ORG Institute of Contemporary Arts] in [LOC London] since 1952 by the [ORG Independent Group]. 
In his 1947 collage I was a Rich Man's Plaything - [PER Paolozzi] used the word " Pop ! 
" graphically to represent a shot from a gun. 
In 1957 [PER Hamilton] recorded, " Pop Art is popular (designed for a mass audience), transient (short-term solution), expendable (easily forgotten), low-cost, mass produced, young (aimed at youth), witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, big business. 
" As a term, " Pop Art " is based on a 1958 text by the art critic, [PER Lawrence Alloway], who retrospectively described the period to 1960 as the first phase in which Pop art was applied to the totality of pop-cultural products (primarily visual mass communication). 
From 1961 to 1964 the term was restricted to art works with figurative representations that were derived from the commercial mass media, such as comic strips and advertising posters. 
During this " iconographic phase of Pop art " a distinction was made between individual motifs and methods of design in the traditional media of painting and sculpture, and attention was directed towards the American artists [PER Warhol], [PER Rauschenberg], [PER Lichtenstein], [PER Johns], [PER Oldenburg], [PER Rosenquist], [PER Ramos], [PER Indiana], and [PER Dine]. 
These artists' works radicalized the British approach by varying, serially and mechanically, the images of the stars transmitted in the media and banal everyday objects or standardized consumer goods, turning them into images of Pop art. 
Pop art is regarded as having become established internationally in 1965. 
French Nouveau Realisme and, for a short time, the ideas of [LOC Germany] 's Capitalist Realism are generally regarded as the continental European equivalent. 
D.S.” 
“kitsch. 
Term for products without style which lay claim to artistic value. 
The origin of the word is unclear, but it was probably first used in artists' circles in [LOC Munich] in the late 19th century. 
Initially it was applied to paintings sloppily painted as " kitsch " (i. e. to be sold cheaply). 
Craft creation of kitsch went hand in hand with an industrial production, with the emphasis on anti-modern subjects such as roaring stags. 
Kitsch developed to take many forms, from cheap paperbacks, pop songs, and [LOC Hollywood] movies to religious and political propaganda. 
Artists such as [PER Rockwell] and [PER Maxfield Parrish]  (1870-1966) have also been classified as kitsch. 
Kitsch creates a kind of harmony through romantic images, trivializing classical categories of art, supplanting beauty with symmetry, emotion with sentimentality, greatness with pathos, and tragedy with sensation. 
American art critic [PER Clement Greenberg] saw kitsch as being " destined for those who, insensible to the values of genuine culture, are hungry nevertheless for the diversion that only culture of some sort can provide. 
Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. 
" Following the assimilation of mass culture into Pop art in the 1960s and the emergence of Postmodernism in the 1970s, kitsch established itself in the realm of high art, albeit it with an ironic slant, through the, work of artists such as - [PER Koons], [PER Rhonda Zwillinger], and [PER Pierre] & [PER Gilles].

The following information is an excerpt from a lengthy article in [MISC GROVE ART] (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 29 July 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]:[ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]:
" Ideology. 
Term applied primarily to sets of beliefs that are explicitly held by social groups, are general in scope and have practical implications for participation in social life. 
The topic of these beliefs need not itself be social ; religious beliefs as much as economic theories may be ideological. 
The term has, however, fallen into loose usage in sociology and other quarters, and there is much debate as to the correct understanding of the concept.... 
1. 
Introduction. 
By no means every socially accepted set of beliefs with practical implications counts as an ideology. 
The following are plausible, although not universally agreed, conditions for a set of beliefs to qualify as an ideology: (1) the set of beliefs demands explanation in terms of its social causes and effects on social relations rather than what (if anything) makes it true ; (2) the social effects of the beliefs are more important in perpetuating them than the reasons advanced in their support ; (3) the set of beliefs has come into existence because it promotes the interests of a particular social group or at least (in the case of an ascendent class) has the potential for doing so.... 
Carrying over ideological analysis to the arts requires some modifications, since works of art cannot be equated directly with sets of beliefs in common with the other activities and products (e.g. rituals and advertisements) that form a society 's cultural superstructure.... 
2. 
The ideological analysis of art. 
There is more than one way in which the ideological analysis of art may proceed, but its general form will be as follows. 
A certain theory of society -- usually Marxist theory or some variant of it -- is taken for granted at the outset.... 
The writings on art of [PER Karl Marx]  (1818-83) consist only of brief and scattered remarks.... 
At the same time, [PER Marx] implied that art has at least the potential for playing a role in fulfilling the proper, sensuous needs of man, conceived as a material being, and, indeed, that art provides some sort of prototype or ideal for a future form of non-alienated labour, insofar as it anticipates a condition in which the senses would no longer be alienated-a line of thought intimated in [PER Marx] 's recognition that the Greek arts 's till afford us artistic pleasure' and 'count as a norm and an unattainable model'.... 
In sum, [PER Marx] 's writings on art attempt to conceive it in two different ways: first, negatively, as a further expression of the alienation suffered in capitalist society ; and second, positively, as a means to social transformation.... 
This shows, incidentally, that it is by no means a corollary of [PER Marx] 's own ideological theory that Socialist realism should qualify as an emancipatory artistic form or that ideological analysis need reduce to such bald and repellent claims as that the modernist art of 'late bourgeois society' must necessarily be 'd ecadent' (the verdict of georgy [PER Plekhanov] on Cubism).... 
 (see also Abstract art). 
The tension and, arguably, potential for head-on conflict between these two views of the ideological significance of art reappears in many subsequent ideological analyses and leads to such complex notions as that the two ideological roles of art, negative and positive, may be 'd oubled up' in a single work.... 
The two ideological dimensions of art in [PER Marx] 's writings and the possibility of synthesizing them have been extensively developed in the tradition of Marxist aesthetics in the 20th century, where the concept of ideology in all contexts has been revised in multifarious and often highly sophisticated directions.... 
Literary theory has been the principal arena for these developments, but, with appropriate modification, neo- and post-Marxist analyses and theories of literature can be carried over to the visual arts... 
" 
[ Editor truncated copyrighted text above] 
A good dictionary would give you a general definition of the term " ideology, " but to address how it is applied to the study of art and art history, one needs to consider subjects like " Art and Society, " " Art and Politics, " and " Art and Philosophy. 
". 
Also, ideologies can change, so you would need to consider issues like ideologies that existed during a given period of time or within a given country or region or amongst a given group of people. 
These are all large topics to tackle even individually. 
However, the following books listed below may help you to further research the topic of ideology and its relationship to art. 
You can track these titles through your local public or university library. 
If your library doesn't have these books, ask a librarian if they can be ordered through inter-library loan.

Your topic is interesting but extremely broad. 
However, let me get you started on your research by suggesting some general resources that will help you define your subject. 
First, to discuss themes and trends in 20th century American art, you will need to discuss both Modern and Postmodern art. 
The following definitions for these terms is from ARTLEX.COM http://www.artlex.com, an online dictionary of art: 
" Modernism or modernism - An art movement characterized by the deliberate departure from tradition and the use of innovative forms of expression that distinguish many styles in the arts and literature of the late nineteenth and the twentieth century. 
Modernism refers to this period 's interest in new types of paints and other materials, in expressing feelings and ideas, in creating abstractions and fantasies, rather than representing what is real. 
This kind of art requires its audience to observe carefully in order to get some facts about the artist, his intentions, and his environment, before forming judgments about the work... 
" 
" Postmodern or Postmodernism - Art, architecture, or literature that reacts against earlier modernist principles, as by reintroducing traditional or classical elements of style or by carrying modernist styles or practices to extremes. 
" 
You might also want to visit the ARTLEX.COM website for quotes and further information about specific themes and trends of Modernism and PostModernism. 
The world of art is constantly evolving. 
As a result, new - and variations of old - movements, mediums, and techniques are created. 
A good resource for the study of modern art and recent trends is [PER Amy Dempsey] 's book, [MISC ART IN THE MODERN ERA: A GUIDE TO STYLES, SCHOOLS & MOVEMENTS 1860 TO THE PRESENT] ([LOC New York]: [ORG Harry N. Abrams], 2002). 
You can try to find this resource at your local public or university library, or ask a librarian if it can be ordered through interlibrary loan. 
A timeline from [MISC ART IN THE MODERN ERA] lists the following schools of art as popular ones in the last 15 years. 
Many were developed in the 1960s, but artists continue to work in the styles today: 
 High-Tech
 Site Works 
 Fluxus 
 Body Art
 Super-realism 
 Arte-Povera 
 Kinetic Art 
 Sound Art
 Internet Art 
 Earth Art
 Postmodernism 
 Neo-Pop 
 Neo-Expressionism 
 Installation
 Outsider Art 
 Transavanguardia 
 Performance Art
 Video Art
Of this list,  Internet Art,  Neo-Pop,  Neo-Expressionism, and  Transavanguardia were developed in the 1980s or later. 
Below are excerpts of these four types of art from ART IN THE MODERN ERA: 
1) Internet Art
Internet Art is, above all, democratic, and interactivity is its key feature. 
Images, text, motion and sound, assembled by artists, can be navigated by viewers to create their own multimedia montages of which the ultimate `authorship' is open to question... 
2) Neo-Pop 
Neo-Pop  (or Post-Pop) refers to the work of a number of artists who emerged on the [LOC New York] art scene during the late 1980s, particularly [PER Ashley Bickerton]  (b. 
1959), [PER Jeff Koons]  (b. 
1955), [PER Alan McCollum]  (b. 
1944) and [PER Haim Steinbach]  (b. 
1944). 
One of the many strains of *Postmodernism, Neo-Pop reacted to the dominance of *Minimalism and *Conceptual Art during the 1970s. 
Using 1960s *Pop Art methods, materials and images as a starting point, Neo-Pop also reflected the heritage of Conceptual Art in its sometimes ironic and objective style... 
3) Neo-Expressionism 
The term Neo-Expressionism expanded to cover a shared tendency rather than a specific style - as did *Expressionism earlier in the twentieth century. 
Broadly speaking, NeoExpressionist work is characterized by technical and thematic features. 
The handling of materials tends to be tactile, sensuous or raw, and vibrantly expressive of emotions. 
Subjects frequently display a deep involvement with the past, either collective history or personal memory, explored through allegory and symbolism. 
Neo-Expressionist work draws on the history of painting, sculpture and architecture, employing traditional materials and themes... 
4) Transavanguardia 
The Italian art critic [PER Achille Bonito Oliva] named the Italian version of *Neo-Expressionism Transavanguardia  (`beyond the avant-garde'), in an article in Flash Arzin October 1979 ; it has been since used to refer to work produced in the 1980s and 1990s by a group of artists comprising [PER Sandro Chia]  (b. 
1946), [PER Francesco Clemente]  (b. 
1952), [PER Enzo Cucchi]  (b. 
1949) and [PER Mimmo Paladino]  (b. 
1948). 

======

Their work marks a return to painting characterized by a certain violence of expression and handling, and by an air of romantic nostalgia for the past. 
Colourful, sensual and dramatic, they convey a real sense of relish in the rediscovery of the tactile and expressive aspects of the materials of painting... 
[MISC ART AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM] (Ed.

His [MISC KING'S-CROSS PHONE-IN] posted on the Web the telephone numbers of thirty-six phone booths in and around the railway station in [LOC London], inviting viewers to call and chat to commuters, injecting an unexpected note of sociability - and anarchy- into business routine. 
The project also showed how protean Internet Art can be, fluently interconnecting with other art forms, such as *Performance Art. 
2) Neo-Pop 
Neo-Pop  (or Post-Pop) refers to the work of a number of artists who emerged on the [LOC New York] art scene during the late 1980s, particularly [PER Ashley Bickerton]  (b. 
1959), [PER Jeff Koons]  (b. 
1955), [PER Alan McCollum]  (b. 
1944) and [PER Haim Steinbach]  (b. 
1944). 
One of the many strains of *Postmodernism, Neo-Pop reacted to the dominance of *Minimalism and *Conceptual Art during the 1970s. 
Using 1960s *Pop Art methods, materials and images as a starting point, Neo-Pop also reflected the heritage of Conceptual Art in its sometimes ironic and objective style. 
3) Neo-Expressionism
The term Neo-Expressionism expanded to cover a shared tendency rather than a specific style - as did *Expressionism earlier in the twentieth century. 
Broadly speaking, NeoExpressionist work is characterized by technical and thematic features. 
The handling of materials tends to be tactile, sensuous or raw, and vibrantly expressive of emotions. 
Subjects frequently display a deep involvement with the past, either collective history or personal memory, explored through allegory and symbolism. 
Neo-Expressionist work draws on the history of painting, sculpture and architecture, employing traditional materials and themes. 
As a result, the influence of Expressionism, *Post-Impressionism, *Surrealism, *Abstract Expressionism, *Art Informel and *Pop Art is very apparent. 
Important contemporary figures included German Conceptual artist [PER Joseph Beuys]  (1921-86), whose examples of political involvement and handling of expressive materials were particularly inspirational, and American [PER Philip Guston]  (1912-80), the Abstract Expressionist who shocked the art world in the late 1960s with his conversion to boldly figurative comical work.. 
4) [Transavanguardia 
The [Italian] art critic [PER Achille Bonito Oliva] named the Italian version of *Neo-Expressionism Transavanguardia  (`beyond the avant-garde'), in an article in Flash Arzin October 1979 ; it has been since used to refer to work produced in the 1980s and 1990s by a group of artists comprising [PER Sandro Chia]  (b. 
1946), [PER Francesco Clemente]  (b. 
1952), [PER Enzo Cucchi]  (b. 
1949) and [PER Mimmo Paladino]  (b. 
1948). 
Their work marks a return to painting characterized by a certain violence of expression and handling, and by an air of romantic nostalgia for the past. 
Colourful, sensual and dramatic, they convey a real sense of relish in the rediscovery of the tactile and expressive aspects of the materials of painting. 
[MISC ART AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM] (Ed.

" African American art 
3. c 1960 and after. 
In the 1960s and 1970s new classifications appeared in African American art based on continuing developments in abstract art and the rise of the figurative style known as Black Expressionism. 
A new generation of artists came to prominence, influenced by such developments as Abstract Expressionism, colour field painting and hard-edge painting. 
These artists produced large, colourful, non-representational art that was not racially identifiable: such work was more successful commercially and more likely to be included in museums, exhibitions and galleries than that of the [ORG Black Expressionists]. 
The most prominent African American abstract painter was [PER Sam Gilliam], based in [LOC Washington], [LOC DC], whose colour field painting employed folded, draped and hanging canvases as well as other forms of support (e.g. 
Abstraction, acrylic on aluminium-treated paper, 1969 ; [LOC Washington], [LOC DC][LOC Evans-Tibbs Col.], see 1989 exh. cat., p.

If location and cost are not factors, I suggest you look at the course offerings at the various library schools. 
I know that art librarianship courses are not offered at all library schools and those that do offer a course may not do so every year. 
At times, a course on art librarianship has been offered at [ORG Indiana University], [ORG Pratt Institute], and [ORG University of Maryland].

There appear to be two types of " intention " in the art world. 
Psychological intention refers to what the artist supposedly had in mind when he created the work of art. 
Aesthetic intention refers to the total effect that the work is supposed to have on its viewers. 
According to Words of Art, compiled by [PER Robert J. Belton], of the [ORG Okanagan University College Department of Fine Arts], intentions are the real or supposed motives of an artist in making a particular work. 
Intentionalism is the interpretive strategy that gives priority to the intentions - whether known or inferred - of the artist. 
The idea is currently in disfavor in the critical community because we cannot construe the author 's intentions from the work in the absence of corroborating evidence (the artist 's words, letters, or workbooks) outside the work, especially if the author is dead. 
Part of the problem with the issue of intentions in determining the meaning of a work of art is the degree to which a given artist is even conscious of those intentions. 
On the other hand, " aesthetic intention " focuses our interest on the work as an aesthetic object. 
It, according to [PER Jerome Stolnitz] 's Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art Criticism (p. 
481), induces the critic to ask, " What is this work trying to achieve, as an aesthetic vehicle ? 
" this leads the critic to ask, " How is this effect achieved ? 
" this will lead to an examination of the intrinsic structure of the work. 
It is difficult to address your question without additional contextual information. 
For example, are you researching a particular period, movement or theme in American art ? 
Are you researching a particular artist ? 
Approaches to different American art topics will differ, depending on the specific topic. 
Having said that, I can give you some guidance both on finding primary resources and on researching art topics in general. 
If you are new to art research, you may find the following title particularly useful: 
[PER Jones, Lois Swan].

The [ORG Archives of American Art] collects and makes available artists papers, records from art dealers/galleries, papers and letters of art historians and art collectors, records from art museums and art organizations, and interviews from their oral history project. 
Art Inventories Catalog: This catalog encompasses listings of paintings and sculpture in the Inventory of American Paintings Executed Before 1914 and in the Inventory of American Sculpture. 
The Inventories Catalog is a census of works in public and private collections, and each work listed is described with the following information: artist, title of work, date of execution, medium, dimensions, subject, owner 's name and address (if known), reference citation, source of illustration. 
[PER Peter A. Juley] and Son Collection Catalog: [PER Peter A. Juley] and his son [PER Paul] photographed American art and artists between 1896 and 1975. 
The collection consists of 127,000 photographs representing the work of about 10,000 American artists. 
Pre-1877 Art Exhibition Catalogue Index: Consists of more than 100,000 records of works represented in fine art exhibitions in the [LOC United States] and [LOC Canada] before 1877. 
Smithsonian Libraries Catalog: Here you can search the library holdings for [ORG Smithsonian Institution Libraries]. 
Your local or university library may have access to subscription archival databases, such as ArchivesUSA (published by [PER Chadwyck-Healey]) or the [ORG Research Library Group] 's databases, Archival Resources. 
If so, these are excellent resources to explore. 
The [ORG Research Libraries Group] also publishes a database titled the English Short Title Catalogue, which lists letterpress materials published in [LOC Great Britain] and its colonies between 1473 and 1800. 
If your research focuses on the 19th century, you may wish to search periodical indexes such as: 
[PER Schmid, Mary Morris].

Finding actual works of art can be simple or difficult, depending on your particular area of interest. 
There exists, for many artists, monographs called catalogue raisonnes. 
A catalogue raisonne is a complete listing of a given artist 's works. 
If a catalogue raisonne exists for the artist/s you are researching, it will be easier for you to track his/her works. 
If a catalogue raisonne does not exist for an artist, then you will need to utilize general monographs on an artist, exhibition catalogues, museum catalogues, indexes to auction sales, indexes to exhibitions, periodical indexes, and the artist 's papers (if they exist). 
Finding complete listings of works for portrait artists can be particularly challenging since they generally worked from commissions and did not need to rely on exhibiting to sell their works. 
 (Sometimes an exhibition record will be the only documentation that you might find for a given work. 
) 
good place to begin would be the Web site for The [ORG American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]  (http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/aic/ [ December 2003]). 
On this site, you can read about " Caring for Your Treasures. 
" Keeping in mind that art restoration should not be undertaken by amateurs, you will also find information on selecting an art conservator.

The relationship between geometry and art is best seen in art movements known as " Op Art", " Cubism" and " Geometric Abstraction. 
" 
The following article on Op Art is from [MISC GROVE ART]  (http://www.groveart.com/, accessed 10 July 2003). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove 's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC Grove Art]:
" Op art. 
Term used as an abbreviation of 'optical art' to refer to painting and sculpture that exploits the illusions or optical effects of perceptual processes. 
It was used for the first time by a writer in an unsigned article in Time magazine (23 Oct 1964) and entered common usage to designate, in particular, two-dimensional structures with strong psychophysiological effects.... 
The origins of Op art can be traced from both the art-historical tradition and from popular art, in particular from ornament, trompe l'oeil and anamorphosis.... 
[PER Vasarely] began working with graphic elements on the surface plane before superimposing them on transparent materials in order to obtain subtle visual effects.... 
From 1961 [PER Riley] obtained strong black and white effects,... 
[PER Soto] 's research into optical vibrancy began in 1952 when he experimented with various chromatic and luminous elements distributed over the surface before he arrived at the moiré effect, which he favoured as a means of making solid objects such as wire structures appear to dissolve.... 
Agam similarly constructed works that depended on the spectators' participation.... 
In his Physichromies (from 1959) [PER Cruz-Diez] applied a theory of additive colours, combining a technique of regularly spaced card strips with earlier experiments with colour.... 
Through their roles in the Groupe de recherche d'art visuel, [PER Le Parc] and [PER Morellet] already had the development of a new visual situation as an ultimate objective ; their interest lay exclusively in the object/eye relationship rather than in the object considered for its intrinsic plastic properties.... 
In the [LOC USA] the beginnings of Op art, in particular the chromatic element, were dominated by the work of [PER Josef Albers.]... 
Although Op art must be considered in its entirety as an ephemeral art trend, it has nevertheless had some permanent effects on the perceptual qualities of the spectator, on the relationship between artists, architects and town planners and on the systematic application of optical phenomena in technologically highly-developed art forms. 
" 
[ Editor truncated copyrighted text above] 
In terms of Cubism, the [MISC DICTIONARY OF ART TERMS AND TECHNIQUES] by [PER Ralph Mayer]  ([LOC New York]:[ORG Barnes and Noble Books], 1969), defines the term as follows: 
" A revolutionary art movement (1907-1914) of which the leading figures were [PER Georges Braque]  (1882-1963) and [PER Pablo Picasso]  (1881-1973). 
The Cubist style had three stages of development: Facet CUBISM, in which the artist started to separate objects or figures into definite, geometrical elements of facets, while placing them in a composition which still showed the influence of [PER Cezanne] ; Analytical [PER CUBISM], in which objects were increasingly broken down and 'analyzed' through such means as simultaneous rendition, the presentation of several aspects of an object at once ; and Synthetic [PER CUBISM], in which the artist was further liberated from traditional reality, appearance and illusion. 
CUBISM in its early phase was encouraged by the then current Parisian interest in [PER Cezanne], [PER Seurat] and African sculpture. 
The collage or paste-up technique and the use of such materials as sand and cloth on canvas were Cubist innovations. 
Despite the enormous hostility with which it was greeted by the world, the Cubist movement was epochal. 
It was the inspiration or point of departure of many an artist in the next few decades. 
Its innate vigor and productiveness were the result of the intensive collaboration between [PER Picasso] and [PER Braque], who were later joined by [PER Juan Gris]  (1887-1927) and [PER Fernand Leger]  (1881-1955) ".

You also might be interested in the following definition of geometric abstraction from [PER John Walker] 's [MISC GLOSSARY OF ART, ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN SINCE 1945] ([LOC Boston]: [ORG G. K. Hall], 1992) : 
" Geometric Abstraction: A subcategory of modern abstract art, encompassing both sculpture and painting, which finds in geometric forms--circles, spheres, rectangles, cubes, triangles, pyramids, etc. -- universal symbols for rational, idealist concepts. 
Typically, Geometric Abstraction painters employ primary colors which are painted in a flat, impersonal manner to generate shapes with hard edges, e.g. 
[PER Kasimir Malevich], [PER Piet Mondrian], [PER Theo van Doesburg], [PER Max Bill], [PER Alexander Liberman], [PER Burgoyne Diller], [PER Ellsworth Kelly], [PER Frank Stella]. 
Because of its cool rationality, this kind of work has also been called 'cold abstraction' and described as 'hygienic.' 
This kind of art developed largely in [LOC Europe] in the years between the two World Wars and was associated with the Bauhaus, concrete art, de Stijl and international constructivism. 
In the 1940s and 50s abstract art went through an anti-geometric phase as most painters favoured a gestural, intuitive approach. 
However, by the early 1960s geometry had made a come-back with such movements as hard-edge painting, op and minimal art.

" Migration period. 

=======


Term used to describe a period spanning the decline and fall of the Roman Empire and the foundation of the medieval Christian kingdoms of [LOC Europe] between the 5th and 8th centuries AD. 
The arts of the European Migration period are varied, reflecting the styles, techniques and beliefs of the many different peoples involved, yet there are so many common features that it is possible to speak of Migration period art as a unified concept. 
From the surviving evidence, it is mainly a metalworkers’ art, carried out in a highly skilled manner by able craftsmen ; the stone sculpture and architecture of the Classical civilizations were copied, though with a different approach. 
There must also have been much richly decorated organic material, but the survival of wood, leather and textiles is only fragmentary. 
1. 
Historical background. 
...In the first few centuries AD there were two main currents of migration. 
The Goths, peoples from [LOC Scandinavia] and the Baltic area, moved south-eastwards to settle in the lands north of the [LOC Black Sea]. 
There was also a strong east to west movement, originating in [LOC Asia] and bringing the Huns into eastern [LOC Europe] ; this caused the peoples whom they displaced to put pressure on the eastern frontiers of the Roman Empire.... 
2. 
Artistic influences. 
An important characteristic of Germanic art was its ability to absorb and transform new influences.... 
3. 
Peoples. 
Despite the general unity of style, there is some variety in the evidence for the different areas and peoples, with contrasting cemetery contents and other material remains.... 
4. 
Styles. 
Although the various peoples of the Migration period came from different backgrounds and were influenced by the art of the various areas in which they settled, the dominating impression of their art is its uniformity.... 
5. 
Techniques. 
The great contribution of the Migration period to medieval art was the range of techniques employed by the jewellers and metalworkers, whose products form the most substantial surviving material remains of the period....

The following definition of Pop Art is from [MISC ARTLEX.COM]  (http://www.artlex.com), an online dictionary of art terms: 
" Pop Art: An art movement and style that had its origins in [LOC England] in the 1950s and made its way to the [LOC United States] during the 1960s. 
Pop Artists have focused attention upon familiar images of the popular culture such as billboards, comic strips, magazine advertisements, and supermarket products. 
Leading exponents are [PER Richard Hamilton],  British, 1922-), [PER Andy Warhol]  (American, 1928-1930 ? -1987), [PER Roy Lichtenstein]  (American, 1923-1997), [PER Claes Oldenburg]  (American, 1929-), [PER Jasper Johns]  (American, 1930-), and [PER Robert Rauschenberg]  (American, 1925-).

This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]:
"Pop Art. 
International movement in painting, sculpture and printmaking. 
The term originated in the mid-1950s at the [LOC ICA], [LOC London], in the discussions held by the Independent group concerning the artefacts of popular culture... 
[PER Lawrence Alloway]  (1926–1990), the critic who first used the term in print in 1958, conceived of Pop art as the lower end of a popular-art to fine-art continuum, encompassing such forms as advertising, science-fiction illustration and automobile styling. 
[PER Hamilton] defined Pop in 1957 as: ‘Popular (designed for a mass audience) ; Transient (short term solution) ; Expendable (easily forgotten) ; Low Cost ; Mass Produced; Young  (aimed at Youth) ; Witty ; Sexy ; Gimmicky ; Glamorous ; and Big Business’. 
[PER Hamilton] set out, in paintings such as £he (1958–61 ; [LOC London], [ORG Tate]), to explore the hidden connotations of imagery taken directly from advertising and popular culture, making reference in the same work to pin-ups and domestic appliances as a means of commenting on the covert eroticism of much advertising presentation (for illustration see [PER Hamilton], richard)... 
In the mid-1950s in [LOC America], independently of the activities in [LOC England], the terms for certain aspects of Pop art were established by [PER Jasper Johns] and [PER Robert Rauschenberg]. 
The irony and anti-art gestures of their work initially attracted the term ‘neo-Dada’. 
[PER Johns] took as his imagery ‘things the mind already knows’, such as the American flag, maps, targets (see [PER Johns, Jasper], fig. 
1), arabic numerals and the alphabet. 
By changing the format, colour and medium, he demonstrated the formal and philosophical possibilities of an austere and direct presentation of blandly familiar images. 
Rauschenberg’s self-styled 'combines' such as Monogram (1955–9 ; [LOC Stockholm], Mod. 
Mus. 
) were roughly made paintings and sculptures that incorporated photographs, newspapers and disparate objects collected in the street. 
Like [PER Johns], [PER Rauschenberg] applied techniques from Abstract Expressionist painting to recognizable imagery and inspired many artists to dwell on subject-matter drawn from their immediate urban environment. 
Another American artist, [PER Larry Rivers], also provided a transition to Pop art in paintings such as Dougherty Ace of Spades (1960 ; [LOC Provincetown], [LOC MA], [PER Chrysler A. Mus]. 
), basing both format and imagery on ordinary objects such as playing cards, cigarette packets and restaurant menus. 
Themes from contemporary life were similarly introduced in the Happenings devised in the late 1950s by performance artists such as [PER Allan Kaprow], [PER Claes Oldenburg], [PER Jim Dine] and [PER Red Grooms]  (b 1937). 
American Pop art emerged suddenly in the early 1960s and was in general characterized by a stark and emblematic presentation that contrasted with the narrative and analytical tendencies of its British counterpart. 
At its most rigorous, American Pop art insisted on a direct relationship between its use of the imagery of mass production and its adoption of modern technological procedures. 
Whereas British Pop art often celebrated or satirized consumer culture, American Pop artists tended to have a more ambiguous attitude towards their subject-matter, nowhere more so than in the mixture of glamour and pathos that characterized [PER Andy Warhol]’s silkscreened icons of [LOC Hollywood] film stars, as in The [PER Marilyn Diptych]  (1962 ; [LOC London], Tate ; see fig. 
). 
Compared to the disparate nature of British Pop art, from the early 1960s American Pop art appeared to be a unified movement. 
Its shared formal characteristics included aggressively contemporary imagery, anonymity of surface, strong, flatly applied colours and a stylistic unity often associated with centralized compositions. 
Each of the American artists was quick to establish his or her identity, often with the ironic suggestion that the art was like any consumer product or brand name to be marketed. 
Foremost among them were [PER Warhol]’s testams to machine-line production and to capitalism, such as 80 Two-dollar bills (1962 ; [LOC Cologne], Mus. 
[PER Ludwig]), and [PER Roy Lichtenstein]’s formalized enlargements of the frames of comic strips, often violent or melodramatic, for example Drowning Girl (1963 ; [LOC New York], [ORG MOMA] ; for further illustration see [PER Lichtenstein], roy ; see also Still-life, fig. 
9). 
[PER Oldenburg] produced sculptural paraphrases of ordinary objects, often on a huge scale, as in Floor-burge (Giant Hamburger) (1962 ; [LOC Toronto], [ORG A.G. Ont]. 
), while [PER James Rosenquist] favoured dream-like combinations of grossly enlarged familiar images, which he painted in the manner of billboard advertisements, such as I Love you with my [ORG Ford]  (1962 ; [LOC Stockholm], Mod. 
Mus. 
). 
[PER Tom Wesselmann] specialized in provocatively posed female nudes and in domestic still-lifes of consumer products, for example Still-life #30 (1963 ; [LOC New York], [ORG MOMA]). 
Other painters working in the [LOC USA] associated with Pop art included [PER Jim Dine], who consistently rejected the term, [PER Richard Artschwager], [PER Billy Al Bengston]  (b 1934), [PER Allan D’Arcangelo], [PER Öyvind Fahlström], [PER Joe Goode]  (b 1937), [PER Robert Indiana], [PER Ray Johnson], [PER Mel Ramos]  (b 1935), [PER Edward Ruscha], [PER Wayne Thiebaud] and [PER John Wesley]  (b 1928), as well as the sculptors [PER Marisol] and [PER George Segal]. 
Notable among related developments that took place in other countries was Nouveau réalisme in [LOC France].

In terms of impact that Pop Art had, the following excerpt is from an article on Pop Art in the [MISC BRITANNICA ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN ART] ([ORG Chicago]: [ORG Encyclopaedia Britannica], 1973) p.444: 
"...Like the abstract expressionist painters, each of the major pop artists developed his own style and image independently, though all share a common point of view. 
By exploring a level of reality existing beneath the glossy facade of American life, they have attempted to challenge many of our assumptions, underscored the unique shapes and colors of the everyday world, explored the psychological overtones of visual cliches, and in the process, affected our way of looking at the world around us...

According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
" Video art. 
Term used to describe art that uses both the apparatus and processes of television and video. 
It can take many forms: recordings that are broadcast, viewed in galleries or other venues, or distributed as tapes or discs ; sculptural installations, which may incorporate one or more television receivers or monitors, displaying 'live' or recorded images and sound ; and performances in which video representations are included.... 
By 1969, when the [ORG Howard Wise Gallery], [LOC New York], presented the landmark exhibition TV as a Creative Medium, a fascination with electronic effects and complex imagery had been joined by other concerns.... 
In the 1970s a number of artists in [LOC Europe] and the [LOC USA] shared a commitment to video art as an autonomous form, rather than as documentation or a source of abstract imagery.... 
In the late 1970s work by [PER Bill Viola]  (b 1951), [PER Kit Fitzgerald] and [PER John Sanborn] suggested a reaction against the self-referential tendency, accompanied by an advance in video production techniques... 
During the 1980s video art established its own context of production, exhibition and criticism, with organizations emerging in [LOC North America] and western [LOC Europe] to support and promote 'video culture'.... 
Video art, no longer novel nor wholly dependent on a gallery context, had become part of an increasingly elaborate network of electronic communication.

The following excerpt on Abstract Expressionism -- from a longer article in [MISC THE BRITANNICA ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN ART] ([LOC Chicago]:[ORG Encyclopaedia Britannica], 1973) -- should get you started: 
" Abstract Expressionism: 
The dominant movement in experimental American painting during the 1940s and 1950s and doubtless the most significant independent direction in the history of American painting. 
The term was first used in 1919 to describe certain paintings by the Russian expressionist painter [PER Vasily Kandinsky] and was used in the same context by [PER Alfred Barr], critic and museum director, in 1929. 
The critic [PER Robert Coates] applied the term to a number of younger American painters in 1946, particularly to [PER Willem de Kooning], [PER Jackson Pollock], and their followers. 
The critic [PER Harold Rosenberg] coined the phrase 'action painting' to describe the same tendencies, and the more neutral term '[ORG New York School]' has also been used for the ferment among American painters during the 1940s and 1950s. 
And the next definition is from [MISC ARTLEX: VISUAL ARTS DICTIONARY] (http://www.artlex.com/ [ January 2004]) : 
"Abstract Expressionism or abstract expressionism - A painting movement in which artists typically applied paint rapidly, and with force to their huge canvases in an effort to show feelings and emotions, painting gesturally, non-geometrically, sometimes applying paint with large brushes, sometimes dripping or even throwing it onto canvas. 
Their work is characterized by a strong dependence on what appears to be accident and chance, but which is actually highly planned. 
Some Abstract Expressionist artists were concerned with adopting a peaceful and mystical approach to a purely abstract image. 
Usually there was no effort to represent subject matter. 
Not all work was abstract, nor was all work expressive, but it was generally believed that the spontaneity of the artists' approach to their work would draw from and release the creativity of their unconscious minds. 
The expressive method of painting was often considered as important as the painting itself.... 
" 
Of course, many books have been published on this subject, too, and you can track them through your local public or university library. 
The concept " what is art ? 
" is difficult to grasp because it is highly subjective (often a matter of personal opinion). 
I have included a " definition " from [MISC ARTLEX: VISUAL ARTS DICTIONARY] (http://www.artlex.com/ [ January 2004] : 
" art - For numerous reasons, the most difficult word to define without starting endless argument ! 
Many definitions have been proposed. 
At least art involves a degree of human involvement -- through manual skills or thought -- as with the word 'artificial, ' meaning made by humans instead of by nature. 
Definitions vary in how they divide all that is artificial into what is and isn't art. 
The most common means is to rely upon the estimations of art experts and institutions. 
More useful may be to see definitions of aesthetics, the arts, beaux-art, craft, high art, and low art. 
" 
Also, you might want to follow up with a trip to your local public or school library, where you can track books an the subject of art appreciation. 
For example: 
[MISC LEARNING TO LOOK] by [PER Joshua Charles Taylor]  ([LOC Chicago]: [ORG University of Chicago Press], 1981) 
[MISC ADVENTURING IN ART] by [PER Lois Bartlett Tracy]  ([ORG Pineapple Press], 1990)

[MISC THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO ART] edited by [PER Brigitte Govignon]  ([LOC New York]: [ORG Harry N. Abrams], 1998) 
The first definition of " semiotics " is from ARTLEX http://www.artlex.com that may be helpful to you: 
" Semiotic or semiotics - Of or relating to semantics ; a linguistic, or literary study of the meaning of forms--signs and symbols and what they represent. 
It includes studies of iconography, iconology, and typology " 
A second definition of " semiotics " is from [MISC GROVE ART] 
http://www.groveart.com/ (accessed 7 January 2004). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]: [ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library. 
According to [MISC GROVE ART]: 
" Semiotics. 
Term referring to the analysis of signs and their use.... 
It nevertheless offers a distinctive and cogent technique for dissecting the complexities of visual and verbal communication. 
Semiotics has been applied in various contexts 
within the study of art, producing, for example, semiotic aesthetics (see AESTHETICS, §II, 4)... 

=======


" 
I 've also provided an excerpt from [MISC GROVE ART] that references " semiotic aesthetics " which is mentioned above: 
" 4. 
Art and art-making. 
There is a nest of traditional problems concerning whether and to what extent what is important about art is located in works of art themselves, whether the artist and his act of creation, or more broadly the manner and circumstances in which the work came about, come into play, and in what ways they do. 
Some of these problems are discussed under the rubric of the 'intentional fallacy', but the issues are much larger than that of the relevance of artists' intentions. 
According to [PER Monroe Beardsley] and the 'New Critics', all that matters aesthetically about a work are its intrinsic properties, what is perceptible in it and the effects its perceptible properties have on appreciators ; the artist is important only as a means whereby the work is produced. 
Contrary views take many forms. 
Some have regarded art as essentially a matter of communication between the artist and appreciators, with the work serving as a vehicle of such communication. 
The appreciator 's primary interest is in the person who made the work, in something like what he meant by it, rather than in properties of the work itself.... 
[PER Ernst Gombrich] and [PER Nelson Goodman], among others, contend that a work of art is to be understood in a certain language or in terms of certain conventions, and that identifying the relevant language or conventions requires going beyond a work 's intrinsic properties (see also Iconography and iconology ; semiotics ; and Symbol). 
Communication may involve such conventions, but in some views what an appreciator is primarily interested in is what the work itself means, given the relevant conventions, rather than what the artist meant by it or communicated by means of it....

Your best resources for information on the censorship of art will probably be found in publications that you can track through your local public or university library. 
For example, I would recommend the following references for background information on censorship and art:

Also, you might try searching magazine indexes like the ART INDEX, available in many public and university libraries, and the READERS GUIDE TO PERIODICAL LITERATURE. 
" Art--censorship " is a common subject heading. 
You should be able to find many articles on censorship and art. 
For example: 
[PER Heins, Marjorie]. 
" [MISC Public Art, Censorship, and the Constitution]" [MISC PUBLIC ART REVIEW]. v. 6, (Fall/Winter 1994) : p. 
10-12. 
ABSTRACT 
" Part of a special section on freedom of expression in public art in the [LOC United States]. 
The writer discusses public art, censorship, and the Constitution in the [LOC U.S.] Apart from the relatively rare exceptions where the government owns the work, political officials violate the First Amendment when they impose ideological or moral standards on art that receives public support or is exhibited in public spaces. 
Since government bodies in [LOC America] own so much property and provide so much funding and benefits, the notion of censorship being appropriate to art in public places, or art that receives public support, constitutes a major threat to artistic activity. 
The writer concludes with a discussion of examples of censorship and a consideration of the legal rules involved.

ABSTRACT 
" In an address at the [ORG Cleveland Museum of Art], a professor of communication at [ORG Boston University] discusses moral responsibility with regard to censorship and the arts. 
She argues that serious art is exempt from certain claims of censors that ordinary discourse, such as journalism, advertising, or popular music, is not. 
She asserts that society faces a technological and cultural collision because there is no collective standard to which art must ascribe and because there is no collective understanding of morality.

ABSTRACT 
" Artists and traditional moralists are locked in a fierce battle over obscenity, censorship, and government funding for the arts. 
The discovery that some controversial works of art, including photographs by [PER Andres Serrano] and [PER Robert Mapplethorpe], received financial support from the [ORG National Endowment for the Arts]  ([ORG NEA]) has brought the disagreement to the forefront of public and official attention. 
At the instigation of Sen. [PER Jesse Helms] and Rep. [PER Dana Rohrabacher], [ORG Congress] has set restrictions on the kinds of art that the [ORG NEA] may fund. 
A [LOC Cincinnati] museum curator has been indicted for showing [PER Mapplethorpe] 's homoerotic photographs. 
Artists, who were caught off guard by the latest antiobscenity campaign, have begun to fight back, and a poll indicates that the majority of Americans share their opposition to censorship.

[ORG National Endowment for the Arts] 
ABSTRACT 
" Republican senator [PER Jesse Helms] of [LOC North Carolina], who sponsored an amendment to bar federal funds for " obscene or indecent " art, has triggered heated debate in [ORG Congress] over whether the government has the right to censor art or whether it should subsidize art at all. 
[PER Helms], who initiated the amendment in response to [ORG National Endowment for the Arts]  ([ORG NEA]) funding of shows featuring the homoerotic photographs of [PER Robert Mapplethorpe] and [PER Andres Serrano] 's religious photographs, has promised to force a vote on the subject. 
A House-Senate conference committee will probably establish a commission to examine the [ORG NEA] 's grant-making procedures. 
There is also discussion in [ORG Congress] on whether to do away with federal arts funding entirely. 
The arts community, meanwhile, is already undergoing a form of self censorship to avoid the five-year ban on federal funding that the [PER Helms] bill proposes for organizations that sponsor controversial art.

And lastly, I have included an entry on " Censorship " from [ORG GROVE ART]  (http://www.groveart.com). 
This is a subscription-based online version of [MISC THE DICTIONARY OF ART], edited by [PER Jane Turner]  ([LOC New York]:[ORG Grove's Dictionaries], 1996), a multi-volume, authoritative art encyclopedia that you may be able to find in your local university or large public library: 
" Censorship. 
Control of expression that is regarded as outside of and a threat to the religious, political and social orthodoxy of the time. 
Throughout history, when governments and other powerful institutions of society have been fearful of the power of art to challenge the established order, they have sought to suppress the works of literature and art that appear decadent, disruptive, indecent or immoral.... 
Plato’s distrust of the visual arts derived from the premise that representation can deceive by seeming real. 
In this regard, he urged that deceptions be avoided by the adoption of standardized canons. 
Such canons are a form of censorship, since they prohibit or strongly discourage deviations from the norm.... 
Religious orthodoxies have often provided the parameters of what is or is not acceptable to be seen by an audience. 
The censorship of religious art, including the banning, destruction or alteration of works, is roughly equated with the term Iconoclasm,... 
[PER Girolamo Savonarola] was not as much opposed to the use of paintings in the service of religion as he was to indecent pictures and, especially, of nudity. 
This trend was supported by church leaders for almost 200 years. 
[PER Michelangelo] was accused of showing too much nudity in a sacred work and of not following the regulations of the Council of Trent;... 
Politics and ideology play a role in every act of censorship. 
For example, in [LOC Japan], from the 18th century to the early 20th, public morality and the ‘proper’ way to depict the past and present preoccupied the ruling élite.... 
More than 200 years after the Edo laws, incidents in the [LOC USA]...also raised the spectre of government involvement in artistic expression for many of the same reasons as in [LOC Tokugawa][LOC Japan]. 
However, if the impulse to enforce social conformity is a very old one, in the [LOC USA] the right of the nation and of the states to maintain a decent society has often found itself in conflict with the US Constitution’s First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and, by implication, freedom of artistic expression. 
Such legislation does not exist in totalitarian regimes, in which the relationship between censorship and Propaganda may be most explicit.... 
Boime proposed that all art is political, whether it directly serves the needs of the State or seems to hover in the realm of fantasy or escapism. 
He claimed that the martialling of sculpture and its related cultural conditions was not the result of chance but was deliberately designed to complement political policy or social aspirations.... 
Erotic art continues to be the subject of censorship.... 
The idea that art is appropriate for some, but not others, is a characteristic of censorship that goes back at least to [PER Aristotle]... . 
By the late 20th century corporate sponsorship had, according to some, created an institutionalized censorship of the cultural realm.... 
....He and his colleagues in other corporations know that only high-visibility, non-controversial art events that pack in the crowds yield what they are looking for. 
Events with high entertainment value are best suited to the sponsor’s desire to bask in the glow of culture, at peace with the world.

" Post-modernism. 
Term used to characterize developments in architecture and the arts in the 1960s and after, when there was a clear challenge to the dominance of modernism ; the term was applied predominantly from the 1970s to architecture and somewhat later to the decorative and visual arts. 
It was first used as early as 1934 by Spanish writer [PER Federico de Onis], although it was not then used again until [PER Arnold Toynbee] 's A Study of History in 1938 (published after [MISC World War II]) ; [PER Toynbee] and others saw the 'post-modern' phenomenon in largely negative terms, as an irrational reaction to modernist rationalism.... 
2. 
Other arts. 
[PER Oldenburg] 's dictum of 1961 characterized the ambience in which Pop art returned to the figure, historical allusion and a dialogue with mass culture. 
It provided models for a break away from modernist principles in architecture as well as art, to which, curiously, the label 'Post-modern' was not attached until somewhat later.... 
The movement was centred around artist-run galleries in [LOC Manhattan] and took much from feminism, performance art, Post-structuralism and deconstruction, calling 'm eaning' itself into question.... 
As in architecture, the growing range of motivations tended to outgrow the Post-modern label, except 
insofar as all polemic arguments united to gainsay the hypocrisies of the modernist position.

I found a reference to " plasticity " in the [MISC MCGRAW-HILL DICTIONARY OF ART] ([LOC New York]: [ORG McGraw-Hill], 1969), Vol. 
4, p. 
390-391: 
" PLASTICITY. 
That quality of a work of art which conveys a sense of tangible, sculptured volume. 
Although it is basic to sculpture, plasticity can be deliberately de-emphasized in that medium, as it can be strongly suggested in painting. 
The term was first applied to the analysis of art by. 
" 
This may give you a place to begin.To get an idea of the many meanings for this word and their origins, try looking at the definitions in the [MISC OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY]  ([ORG OED]), a reference source that gives a word 's etymology (or historical uses and contexts). 
This approach should help clarify the particular definition you wish to target ; check your local public or university library for the availability of the [ORG OED]. 
Of course, plastic is a medium: you might try tracking when it was first used as a medium, since this would give you a sense of when the word became an adjective or an adverb.

Just like the industrial magnates of the past, most of the new high-tech rich are filling their homes with art. 
The most famous collector in the digital world is [PER Peter Norton] of the huge software concern [LOC Norton Utilities], who, along with his wife [PER Eileen], has collected more than 2,700 works over the past 15 years, largely those of African-American and Conceptual artists. 
The new millionaires regularly buy art on impulse at first, either on their own or with the help of a consultant, and although some stop when their walls are filled, others catch the bug of collecting.

The demand for art is reviving following a cataclysmic crash in 1990, when prices overall fell by over 60 percent in six months. 
Although art values have been recovering by about 10 percent annually, beginners and collectors on a budget can still buy a large number of pieces at 50 percent or so below what they sold for at the market 's 1989 peak. 
Growing demand has also increased the chances of being sold second-rate works or outright fakes, however.

Part of a special section on investments. 
Top artwork is selling at sky-high prices, but there are still some bargains out there. 
As those made newly rich by the [LOC U.S.] and European stock-market and restructuring booms are turning toward collecting, a huge amount of money is coming into the market. 
[PER Pablo Picasso] 's [PER Le Reve], for example, was sold at auction in November for $48 million. 
[ORG Christie's Inc.] chairman [PER Christopher Burge] says that prices in the vast middle segment of the art market are fairly weak, however. 
There are also plenty of out-of-favor areas from which small collectors can buy fine works cheaply.
