The NER tool software as originally created at UIUC also continues to be available for download, along with many companion works, via the Cognitive Computation Group website at the Department of Computer Science.

This portion of the ECHO DEPository research grant was completely performed in phase two of the grant, and involved researchers at the University of Illinois, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), and the University of Maryland. A paper addressing this work was presented at the 2009 Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science (Godby, Hswe, Jackson, Klavans, Ratinov, Roth, & Cho, 2009).
