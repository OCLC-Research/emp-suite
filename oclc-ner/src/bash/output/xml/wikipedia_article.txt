<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner"><ner:misc>World War II</ner:misc> , or the Second <ner:misc>World War</ner:misc> , ( often abbreviated WWII ) was a global military conflict which involved a majority of the world 's nations , including all of the great powers , organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis . The war involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel , making it the most widespread war in history . In a state of " total war " , the major participants placed their complete economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . Over 70 million people , the majority of them civilians , were killed , making it the deadliest conflict in human history . The starting date of the war is generally held to be September 1939 with the <ner:misc>German</ner:misc> invasion of <ner:loc>Poland</ner:loc> and subsequent declarations of war on <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> by the <ner:loc>United Kingdom</ner:loc> , <ner:loc>France</ner:loc> and the <ner:misc>British</ner:misc> Dominions . However , as a result of other events , many belligerents entered the war before or after this date , during a period which spanned from 1937 to 1941 . Amongst these main events are the <ner:per>Marco Polo Bridge Incident</ner:per> , the start of <ner:misc>Operation Barbarossa</ner:misc> and the attack on <ner:loc>Pearl Harbour</ner:loc> and <ner:misc>British</ner:misc> and <ner:loc>Netherlands</ner:loc> colonies in <ner:loc>South East Asia</ner:loc> . The <ner:loc>Soviet Union</ner:loc> and the <ner:loc>United States</ner:loc> emerged as the world 's leading superpowers . This set the stage for the <ner:misc>Cold War</ner:misc> , which lasted for the next 45 years . The <ner:org>United Nations</ner:org> was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict . The self determination spawned by the war accelerated decolonization movements in <ner:loc>Asia</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Africa</ner:loc> , while <ner:loc>Western Europe</ner:loc> itself began moving toward integration . In the aftermath of <ner:misc>World War I</ner:misc> , a defeated <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> signed the <ner:org>Treaty</ner:org> of <ner:org>Versailles</ner:org> . This caused <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> to lose a significant portion of its territory , prohibited the annexation of other states , limited the size of <ner:misc>German</ner:misc> armed forces and imposed massive reparations . <ner:loc>Russia</ner:loc> 's civil war led to the creation of the <ner:loc>Soviet Union</ner:loc> which soon was under the control of <ner:per>Joseph Stalin</ner:per> . In <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> , <ner:per>Benito Mussolini</ner:per> seized power as a fascist dictator promising to create a " New <ner:loc>Roman Empire</ner:loc> . " The ruling <ner:org>Kuomintang</ner:org> ( <ner:org>KMT</ner:org> ) party in <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> launched a unification campaign against rebelling warlords in the mid-1920s , but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former <ner:misc>Chinese</ner:misc> communist allies . In 1931 , an increasingly militaristic <ner:misc>Japanese Empire</ner:misc> , which had long sought influence in <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> as the first step of its right to rule <ner:loc>Asia</ner:loc> , used the <ner:misc>Mukden Incident</ner:misc> as justification to invade <ner:loc>Manchuria</ner:loc> ; the two nations then fought several small conflicts until the <ner:per>Tanggu Truce</ner:per> in 1933 . <ner:misc>German</ner:misc> troops at the 1935 <ner:misc>Nuremberg Rally</ner:misc> . <ner:misc>German</ner:misc> troops at the 1935 <ner:misc>Nuremberg Rally</ner:misc> . National Socialist <ner:per>Adolf Hitler</ner:per> became the leader of <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> in 1933 and soon began a massive rearming campaign . This worried <ner:loc>France</ner:loc> and the <ner:loc>United Kingdom</ner:loc> , who had lost much in the previous war , as well as <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> , which saw its territorial ambitions threatened by those of <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> . To secure its alliance , the <ner:misc>French</ner:misc> allowed <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> a free hand in <ner:loc>Ethiopia</ner:loc> , which <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> desired to conquer . The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the <ner:loc>Saarland</ner:loc> was legally reunited with <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> and <ner:per>Hitler</ner:per> repudiated the <ner:org>Treaty</ner:org> of <ner:org>Versailles</ner:org> , speeding up remilitarization and introducing conscription . Hoping to contain <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> , the <ner:loc>United Kingdom</ner:loc> , <ner:loc>France</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> formed the <ner:org>Stresa Front</ner:org> . The <ner:loc>Soviet Union</ner:loc> , concerned due to <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> 's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern <ner:loc>Europe</ner:loc> , concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with <ner:loc>France</ner:loc> . Before taking effect though , the <ner:misc>Franco-Soviet</ner:misc> pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the <ner:org>League of Nations</ner:org> , rendering it essentially toothless and in June 1935 , the <ner:loc>United Kingdom</ner:loc> made an independent naval agreement with <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> easing prior restrictions . The <ner:loc>United States</ner:loc> , concerned with events in <ner:loc>Europe</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Asia</ner:loc> , passed the <ner:org>Neutrality Act</ner:org> in August . In October , <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> invaded <ner:loc>Ethiopia</ner:loc> , with <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> the only major <ner:misc>European</ner:misc> nation supporting her invasion . <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> then revoked objections to <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> 's goal of making <ner:loc>Austria</ner:loc> a satellite state . In direct violation of the <ner:org>Versailles</ner:org> and <ner:loc>Locarno</ner:loc> treaties , <ner:per>Hitler</ner:per> remilitarized the <ner:loc>Rhineland</ner:loc> in March 1936 . He received little response from other <ner:misc>European</ner:misc> powers . When the <ner:misc>Spanish Civil War</ner:misc> broke out in July , <ner:per>Hitler</ner:per> and <ner:per>Mussolini</ner:per> supported fascist General√≠simo <ner:per>Francisco Franco</ner:per> 's nationalist forces in his civil war against the <ner:misc>Soviet-supported Spanish Republic</ner:misc> . Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare and the nationalists would prove victorious in early 1939 . With tensions mounting , efforts to strengthen or consolidate power were made . In October , <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> formed the <ner:misc>Rome-Berlin</ner:misc> Axis and a month later <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> and <ner:loc>Japan</ner:loc> , each believing communism and the <ner:loc>Soviet Union</ner:loc> in particular to be a threat , signed the <ner:misc>Anti-Comintern</ner:misc> Pact , which <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> would join in the following year . In <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> , the <ner:org>Kuomintang</ner:org> and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose <ner:loc>Japan</ner:loc> . Chronology Other dates for the beginning of war include the <ner:misc>Japanese</ner:misc> invasion of <ner:loc>Manchuria</ner:loc> in 1931 , the start of the Second <ner:misc>Sino-Japanese War</ner:misc> in 1937 , or one of several other events . Other sources follow <ner:per>A. J. P. Taylor</ner:per> , who holds that there was a simultaneous <ner:misc>Sino-Japanese War</ner:misc> in <ner:loc>East Asia</ner:loc> , and a Second <ner:misc>European War</ner:misc> in <ner:loc>Europe</ner:loc> and her colonies , but they did not become a <ner:misc>World War</ner:misc> until they merged in 1941 ; at which point the war continued until 1945 . This article uses the conventional dating . The end of the War also has several dates . Some sources end it from the armistice of August 14 , 1945 , rather than the formal surrender ; in some <ner:misc>European</ner:misc> histories , it ended on <ner:misc>V-E Day</ner:misc> . The <ner:org>Treaty</ner:org> of Peace with <ner:loc>Japan</ner:loc> was not signed until 1951 . In mid-1937 , following the <ner:misc>Marco Polo Bridge Incident</ner:misc> , <ner:loc>Japan</ner:loc> began a full invasion of <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> . The <ner:misc>Soviets</ner:misc> quickly lent support to <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> , effectively ending <ner:loc>China</ner:loc> 's prior cooperation with <ner:loc>Germany</ner:loc> . Starting at <ner:loc>Shanghai</ner:loc> , the <ner:misc>Japanese</ner:misc> pushed <ner:misc>Chinese</ner:misc> forces back , capturing the capital <ner:loc>Nanjing</ner:loc> in December . In June of 1938 <ner:misc>Chinese</ner:misc> forces stalled the <ner:misc>Japanese</ner:misc> advance by flooding the <ner:loc>Yellow River</ner:loc> ; though this bought time to prepare their defenses at <ner:loc>Wuhan</ner:loc> , the city was still taken by October . [ During this time , <ner:misc>Japanese</ner:misc> and <ner:misc>Soviet</ner:misc> forces engaged in a minor skirmish at <ner:loc>Lake Khasan</ner:loc> ; in May of 1939 , they became involved in a more serious border war that ended with signing a cease-fire agreement on September 15 and restoring the status quo ante bellum . </ner:content>
