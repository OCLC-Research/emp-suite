<ner:content xmlns:ner="uri:ns:ner">The plebeians and <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> of <ner:loc>Rome</ner:loc> ( in the olden time ) were often at strife with each other concerning the enactment of laws , the cancelling of debts , the division of lands , or the election of magistrates . Internal discord did not bring them to blows , however ; these were dissensions merely and contests within the law , which they composed by making mutual concessions , and with much respect for each other . Once when the plebeians were going to a war they fell into such a controversy , but they did not use the weapons in their hands , but withdrew to the hill , which from this time on was called the Sacred <ner:per>Mount.2 Even</ner:per> then no violence was done , but they created a magistrate for their protection and called him the tribune of the plebs , to serve especially as a check upon the consuls , who were chosen by the <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> , so that the political power should not be exclusively in their hands . Whence arose still greater bitterness , and the magistrates were arrayed in stronger animosity to each other after this event , and the <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> and plebeians took sides with them , each believing that it would prevail over the other by augmenting the power of its own magistrates . In the midst of contests of this kind <ner:per>Marcius Coriolanus</ner:per> , having been banished contrary to justice , took refuge with the <ner:loc>Volsci</ner:loc> and levied war against his country . This is the only case of armed strife that can be found in the ancient seditions , and this was caused by an exile . The sword was never carried into the assembly , and there was no civil butchery until <ner:per>Tiberius Gracchus</ner:per> , while serving as tribune and bringing forward new laws , was the first to fall a victim to internal commotion ; and many others besides , who were assembled with him at the <ner:loc>Capitol</ner:loc> , were slain around the temple . Sedition did not end with this abominable deed . Repeatedly the parties came into open conflict , often carrying daggers ; and occasionally in the temples , or the assemblies , or the forum , some one serving as tribune , or prætor , or consul , or a candidate for those offices , or some person otherwise distinguished , would be slain . Unseemly violence prevailed almost constantly , together with shameful contempt for law and justice . As the evil gained in magnitude open insurrections against the government and large warlike expeditions against the country were undertaken by exiles , or criminals , or persons contending against each other for some office or military command . There were chiefs of factions in different places aspiring to supreme power , some of them refusing to disband the troops intrusted to them by the people , others levying forces against each other on their own account , without public authority . Whichever of them first got possession of the city , the others made war nominally against their adversaries , but actually against their country . They assailed it like a foreign enemy . Ruthless and indiscriminate massacres of citizens were perpetrated . Men were proscribed , others banished , property was confiscated , and some were even subjected to excruciating tortures . No unseemly deed was wanting until , about fifty years after the death of <ner:per>Gracchus</ner:per> , <ner:per>Cornelius Sulla</ner:per> , one of these chiefs of factions , doctoring one evil with another , made himself the absolute master of the state for an indefinite period . Such officials were formerly called dictators – an office created in the most perilous emergencies for six months only , and long since fallen into disuse . <ner:per>Sulla</ner:per> , although nominally elected , became dictator for life by force and compulsion . Nevertheless he became satiated with power and was the first man , so far as I know , holding supreme power , who had the courage to lay it down voluntarily and to declare that he would render an account of his stewardship to any who were dissatisfied with it . And so , for a considerable period , he walked to the forum as a private citizen in the sight of all and returned home unmolested , so great was the awe of his government still remaining in the minds of the onlookers , or their amazement at his laying it down . Perhaps they were ashamed to call for an accounting , or entertained other good feeling toward him , or a belief that his despotism had been beneficial to the state . Thus there was a cessation of factions for a short time while <ner:per>Sulla</ner:per> lived , and a compensation for the evils which <ner:per>Sulla</ner:per> had wrought . After his death the troubles broke out afresh and continued until <ner:per>Gaius Cæsar</ner:per> , who had held the command in <ner:loc>Gaul</ner:loc> by election for some years , was ordered by the <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> to lay down his command . He charged that it was not the wish of the <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> , but of <ner:per>Pompey</ner:per> , his enemy , who had command of an army in <ner:loc>Italy</ner:loc> , and was scheming to depose him . So he sent a proposal that both should retain their armies , so that neither need fear the other 's enmity , or that <ner:per>Pompey</ner:per> should dismiss his forces also and live as a private citizen under the laws in like manner with him-self . Both requests being refused , he marched from <ner:loc>Gaul</ner:loc> against <ner:per>Pompey</ner:per> in the <ner:misc>Roman</ner:misc> territory , entered it , put him to flight , pursued him into <ner:loc>Thessaly</ner:loc> , won a brilliant victory over him in a great battle , and followed him to <ner:loc>Egypt</ner:loc> . After <ner:per>Pompey</ner:per> had been slain by the <ner:misc>Egyptians</ner:misc> <ner:per>Cæsar</ner:per> set to work on the affairs of <ner:loc>Egypt</ner:loc> and remained there until he had settled the dynasty of that country . Then he returned to <ner:loc>Rome</ner:loc> . Having overpowered by war his principal rival , who had been surnamed the Great on account of his brilliant military exploits , he now ruled without disguise , nobody daring any longer to dispute him about anything , and was chosen , next after <ner:per>Sulla</ner:per> , dictator for life . Again all civil dissensions ceased until <ner:org>Brutus</ner:org> and <ner:org>Cassius</ner:org> , envious of his great power and desiring to restore the government of their fathers , slew in the <ner:org>Senate</ner:org> this most popular man , who was also the one most experienced in the art of government . The people mourned for him greatly . They scoured the city in pursuit of his murderers . They buried him in the middle of the forum and built a temple on the place of his funeral pile , and offered sacrifice to him as a god . And now civil discord broke out again worse than ever and increased enormously . <ner:loc>Massacres</ner:loc> , banishments , and proscriptions of both senators and the so-called knights took place straightway , including great numbers of both classes , the chief of factions surrendering their enemies to each other , and for this purpose not sparing even their friends and brothers ; so much does animosity toward rivals overpower the love of kindred . So in td the only one wanting to complete the <ner:misc>Roman</ner:misc> empire as it now stands . In consequence of these exploits he was at once elevated to the rank of a deity while still living , and was the first to be thus distinguished by the <ner:misc>Romans</ner:misc> , and was called by them <ner:per>Augustus</ner:per> . He assumed to himself an authority like <ner:per>Cæsar</ner:per> 's over the country and the subject nations , and even greater than <ner:per>Cæsar</ner:per> 's , not needing any form of election , or authorization , or even the pretence of it . His government being strengthened by time and mastery , and himself successful in all things and revered by all , he left a lineage and succession that held the supreme power in like manner after him . Thus , out of multifarious civil commotions , the <ner:misc>Roman</ner:misc> state passed into solidarity and monarchy . To show how these things came about I have written and compiled piled this narrative , which is well worth the study of those who wish to know the measureless ambition of men , their dreadful lust of power , their unwearying perseverance , and the countless forms of evil . It is especially necessary for me to describe these things beforehand since they are the preliminaries of my <ner:misc>Egyptian</ner:misc> history , and end where that begins , for <ner:loc>Egypt</ner:loc> was seized in consequence of this last civil commotion , <ner:per>Cleopatra</ner:per> having joined forces with <ner:per>Antony</ner:per> . On account of its magnitude I have divided the work , first taking up the events that occurred from the time of <ner:per>Sempronius Gracchus</ner:per> to that of <ner:per>Cornelius Sulla</ner:per> ; next , those that followed to the death of <ner:per>Cæsar</ner:per> . The remaining books of the civil wars treat of those waged by the triumvirs against each other and the <ner:misc>Roman</ner:misc> people , until the end of these conflicts , and the greatest achievement , the battle of <ner:loc>Actium</ner:loc> , fought by <ner:per>Octavius Cæsar</ner:per> against <ner:per>Antony</ner:per> and <ner:per>Cleopatra</ner:per> together , which will be the beginning of the <ner:misc>Egyptian</ner:misc> history . </ner:content>
