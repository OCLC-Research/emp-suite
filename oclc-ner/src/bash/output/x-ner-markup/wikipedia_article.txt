[MISC World War II  ] , or the Second [MISC World War  ] , ( often abbreviated WWII ) was a global military conflict which involved a majority of the world 's nations , including all of the great powers , organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis . 
The war involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel , making it the most widespread war in history . 
In a state of " total war " , the major participants placed their complete economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . 
Over 70 million people , the majority of them civilians , were killed , making it the deadliest conflict in human history . 
The starting date of the war is generally held to be September 1939 with the [MISC German  ] invasion of [LOC Poland  ] and subsequent declarations of war on [LOC Germany  ] by the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC France  ] and the [MISC British  ] Dominions . 
However , as a result of other events , many belligerents entered the war before or after this date , during a period which spanned from 1937 to 1941 . 
Amongst these main events are the [PER Marco Polo Bridge Incident  ] , the start of [MISC Operation Barbarossa  ] and the attack on [LOC Pearl Harbour  ] and [MISC British  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] colonies in [LOC South East Asia  ] . 
The [LOC Soviet Union  ] and the [LOC United States  ] emerged as the world 's leading superpowers . 
This set the stage for the [MISC Cold War  ] , which lasted for the next 45 years . 
The [ORG United Nations  ] was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict . 
The self determination spawned by the war accelerated decolonization movements in [LOC Asia  ] and [LOC Africa  ] , while [LOC Western Europe  ] itself began moving toward integration . 
In the aftermath of [MISC World War I  ] , a defeated [LOC Germany  ] signed the [ORG Treaty  ] of [ORG Versailles  ] . 
This caused [LOC Germany  ] to lose a significant portion of its territory , prohibited the annexation of other states , limited the size of [MISC German  ] armed forces and imposed massive reparations . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's civil war led to the creation of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] which soon was under the control of [PER Joseph Stalin  ] . 
In [LOC Italy  ] , [PER Benito Mussolini  ] seized power as a fascist dictator promising to create a " New [LOC Roman Empire  ] . 
" The ruling [ORG Kuomintang  ] ( [ORG KMT  ] ) party in [LOC China  ] launched a unification campaign against rebelling warlords in the mid-1920s , but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former [MISC Chinese  ] communist allies . 
In 1931 , an increasingly militaristic [MISC Japanese Empire  ] , which had long sought influence in [LOC China  ] as the first step of its right to rule [LOC Asia  ] , used the [MISC Mukden Incident  ] as justification to invade [LOC Manchuria  ] ; the two nations then fought several small conflicts until the [PER Tanggu Truce  ] in 1933 .

National Socialist [PER Adolf Hitler  ] became the leader of [LOC Germany  ] in 1933 and soon began a massive rearming campaign . 
This worried [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , who had lost much in the previous war , as well as [LOC Italy  ] , which saw its territorial ambitions threatened by those of [LOC Germany  ] . 
To secure its alliance , the [MISC French  ] allowed [LOC Italy  ] a free hand in [LOC Ethiopia  ] , which [LOC Italy  ] desired to conquer . 
The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [LOC Saarland  ] was legally reunited with [LOC Germany  ] and [PER Hitler  ] repudiated the [ORG Treaty  ] of [ORG Versailles  ] , speeding up remilitarization and introducing conscription . 
Hoping to contain [LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] formed the [ORG Stresa Front  ] . 
The [LOC Soviet Union  ] , concerned due to [LOC Germany  ] 's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern [LOC Europe  ] , concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with [LOC France  ] . 
Before taking effect though , the [MISC Franco-Soviet  ] pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the [ORG League of Nations  ] , rendering it essentially toothless and in June 1935 , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] made an independent naval agreement with [LOC Germany  ] easing prior restrictions . 
The [LOC United States  ] , concerned with events in [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Asia  ] , passed the [ORG Neutrality Act  ] in August . 
In October , [LOC Italy  ] invaded [LOC Ethiopia  ] , with [LOC Germany  ] the only major [MISC European  ] nation supporting her invasion . 
[LOC Italy  ] then revoked objections to [LOC Germany  ] 's goal of making [LOC Austria  ] a satellite state . 
In direct violation of the [ORG Versailles  ] and [LOC Locarno  ] treaties , [PER Hitler  ] remilitarized the [LOC Rhineland  ] in March 1936 . 
He received little response from other [MISC European  ] powers . 
When the [MISC Spanish Civil War  ] broke out in July , [PER Hitler  ] and [PER Mussolini  ] supported fascist General√≠simo [PER Francisco Franco  ] 's nationalist forces in his civil war against the [MISC Soviet-supported Spanish Republic  ] . 
Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare and the nationalists would prove victorious in early 1939 . 
With tensions mounting , efforts to strengthen or consolidate power were made . 
In October , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Italy  ] formed the [MISC Rome-Berlin  ] Axis and a month later [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Japan  ] , each believing communism and the [LOC Soviet Union  ] in particular to be a threat , signed the [MISC Anti-Comintern  ] Pact , which [LOC Italy  ] would join in the following year . 
In [LOC China  ] , the [ORG Kuomintang  ] and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose [LOC Japan  ] . 
Chronology 
Other dates for the beginning of war include the [MISC Japanese  ] invasion of [LOC Manchuria  ] in 1931 , the start of the Second [MISC Sino-Japanese War  ] in 1937 , or one of several other events . 
Other sources follow [PER A. J. P. Taylor  ] , who holds that there was a simultaneous [MISC Sino-Japanese War  ] in [LOC East Asia  ] , and a Second [MISC European War  ] in [LOC Europe  ] and her colonies , but they did not become a [MISC World War  ] until they merged in 1941 ; at which point the war continued until 1945 . 
This article uses the conventional dating . 
The end of the War also has several dates . 
Some sources end it from the armistice of August 14 , 1945 , rather than the formal surrender ; in some [MISC European  ] histories , it ended on [MISC V-E Day  ] . 
The [ORG Treaty  ] of Peace with [LOC Japan  ] was not signed until 1951 . 
In mid-1937 , following the [MISC Marco Polo Bridge Incident  ] , [LOC Japan  ] began a full invasion of [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Soviets  ] quickly lent support to [LOC China  ] , effectively ending [LOC China  ] 's prior cooperation with [LOC Germany  ] . 
Starting at [LOC Shanghai  ] , the [MISC Japanese  ] pushed [MISC Chinese  ] forces back , capturing the capital [LOC Nanjing  ] in December . 
In June of 1938 [MISC Chinese  ] forces stalled the [MISC Japanese  ] advance by flooding the [LOC Yellow River  ] ; though this bought time to prepare their defenses at [LOC Wuhan  ] , the city was still taken by October . 
[ During this time , [MISC Japanese  ] and [MISC Soviet  ] forces engaged in a minor skirmish at [LOC Lake Khasan  ] ; in May of 1939 , they became involved in a more serious border war that ended with signing a cease-fire agreement on September 15 and restoring the status quo ante bellum .
