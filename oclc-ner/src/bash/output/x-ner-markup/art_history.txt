The [MISC British  ] demand for portraiture increased rapidly in the eighteenth century as members of the wealthy middle class became art patrons in their own right . 
[PER Arthur Devis  ] was a provincial artist who came to live in [LOC London  ] , where sophisticated portraitists of the upper class such as [ORG Reynolds  ] and [ORG Gainsborough  ] dominated the art world . 
[PER Devis  ] received commissions from the middle-class landowning families , merchants , and officials who lived in smaller cities outside [LOC London  ] . 
This informal portrait is a conversation piece , a genre favored by [PER Devis  ] . 
The figures , while full-length , are relatively small and are placed somewhat back in the landscape ; the background is larger and more detailed than in traditional portraiture and describes the subjects' personal and social context . 
[PER Devis  ] devised a repertoire of postures and gestures that he used to express the social status of his sitter . 
[PER Arthur Holdsworth  ] , governor of [LOC Dartmouth Castle  ] , is shown seated , an alert , attentive expression on his face . 
The ship sailing into the mouth of the [LOC River Dart  ] in the background may be a reference to the [PER Holdsworth  ] family 's trading business . 
[PER Holdsworth  ] 's brother-in-law , [PER Thomas Taylor  ] , stands behind him in riding clothes . 
The third man is Captain Stancombe .

THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVERS 
When humans first gave up the dangerous and uncertain life of the hunter and gatherer for the more predictable and stable life of the farmer and herder , the change in human society was so astounding , so fundamental , that it justly has been called the [LOC Neolithic Revolution  ] . 
This revolutionary change in the nature of daily life first occurred in [LOC Mesopotamia  ] a [MISC Greek  ] word that means " the land between the [LOC Tigris  ] and [LOC Euphrates  ] rivers . 
" [LOC Mesopotamia  ] is at the core of the region often called the [ORG Fertile Crescent  ] , a land mass that forms a huge arc from the mountainous border between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Syria  ] through [LOC Iraq  ] to [LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC Zagros Mountain  ] range . 
There humankind first learned how to use the wheel and the plow , how to control floods and construct irrigation canals . 
The land became an oasis – and the presumed setting for the biblical [LOC Garden  ] of [LOC Eden  ] . 
As the region that gave birth to three of the world 's great modern faiths-- [MISC Judaism  ] , Christianity , and [MISC Islam  ] --the [LOC Near East  ] long has been of interest to history and religion students . 
But not until the nineteenth century did systematic excavation open the world 's eyes to the extraordinary art and architecture of the ancient [MISC Mesopotamians  ] . 
The great museums of [LOC Europe  ] quickly began to fill their galleries with stone reliefs depicting warfare and hunting ( figs . 
2-22 , 2-24 , and 2-25 ) and with colossal statues of monstrous human-headed bulls ( fig . 
2-21 ) from the palaces of the [MISC Assyrians  ] , rulers of a northern [MISC Mesopotamian  ] empire during the ninth to the seventh centuries b.c . 
In the treasure-hunting spirit of the era , [PER Austen Henry Layard  ] , one of the pioneers of [MISC Near Eastern  ] archeology , had specific instructions from the [ORG British Museum  ] . 
He was to obtain as many well-preserved artworks as he could while spending the least possible amount of time and money doing so . 
Interest heightened with each new discovery , and [MISC North American  ] museums also began to collect [MISC Near Eastern  ] art . 
Nothing that emerged from the [MISC Mesopotamian  ] soi l attracted as much attention as the treasures [PER Leonard Woolley  ] discovered in the 1920s at the [LOC Royal Cemetery  ] at [LOC Ur  ] in southern [LOC Mesopotamia  ] . 
The interest in the unearthing of lavish third-millennium b.c . 
Sumerian burials rivaled the public fascination with the 1922 discovery of the [MISC Egyptian  ] boy-king [MISC Tutankhamen  ] 's tomb ( see figs . 
3-36 to 3-38 ) . 
The [LOC Ur  ] cemetery was filled with gold objects , jewelry , artworks , and musical instruments ( figs . 
2-8 to 2-11 ) . 
[LOC Europe  ] 's royalty and elite frequently visited the site . 
One of the visitors was the mystery writer [PER Agatha Christie  ] , who later married one of the [MISC British  ] archeologists working at [LOC Ur  ] . 
Her 1936 Murder in [LOC Mesopotamia  ] centers on an excavation in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The discovery of the treasures of ancient [LOC Ur  ] put the [MISC Sumerians  ] once again in a prominent position on the world stage . 
They had been absent for four thousand years .
